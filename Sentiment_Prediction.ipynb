    "The welcome was disappointing. Instead of a refreshing drink, we were handed a small, warm water bottle, which wasn’t a great start. However, the rooms were impressive—clean, spacious, and well-maintained. The bed was comfortable, and the linens were of high quality, ensuring a restful and comfortable night.\n",
    "While the bathroom fittings were modern and functional, the washroom itself was very small. We felt it could have been designed better with more space.\n",
    "The hotel has a swimming pool of decent size, but its maintenance was average. There was no lifeguard on duty, which could be a safety concern. The towels provided near the pool were stinking badly. When we raised this issue, we received a lackluster response stating that the odor was \"permanent\" since the towels were also used for the steam room—this was quite disappointing.\n",
    "On the brighter side, the food was a standout feature. We opted for the dinner and breakfast inclusive package, and both meals were delicious with a wide variety of options. The cuisine was predominantly Indian, which aligned with our preference, and we truly enjoyed every dish. The restaurant staff were warm and attentive, adding to the overall dining experience.\n",
    "In summary, while the stay had its memorable moments, there were several areas that need improvement, particularly in terms of the welcome experience and poolside maintenance. However, the excellent food and restaurant hospitality were redeeming factors.\"\"\"]"
