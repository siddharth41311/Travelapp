Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Barry Sloan;Nice Hotek;Check in was smooth although my room wasn’t ready at 5pm, I was due to arrive at 4pm First night I was in a room overlooking JL Legian which is a very busy load st, I asked if I could be moved the 2nd night and they were very helpful and moved to a great room overlooking 1 of the pools. Overall the staff here are very friendly and helpful, rooms are comfortable. Breakfast buffet is good with plenty to choose from. Water pressure is bad so It’s a little frustrating getting a good shower. Great location but be aware there is a lot of traffic noise. I’d still happily stay here again;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Phoenix G;A Fortnight at Mercure Legian Bali;"Really the rating is 4.7 (I will attempt to make this review short) Mercure is conveniently surrounded by convenience stores, laundry express, restaurants, souvenir & other shopping, and spas (& such). I spent a lot of time writing on that breezy balcony. Positives: At check-in (thank you, Jian), there's a staff porter, with trolley, to help you with any bags from the car; and patiently assists with taking them up to your room. Our check-in (and check-out, thank you Jian & Andi) was smooth and the reception staff were all kind (during our full 2week stay). The rooms are nicely situated and the balcony set-up affords you some privacy - even with a neighbor. Great aircon, workstation, closet space (you won't have to live out of your s tcase), and spacious bathroom with";5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Brenda;Best Bali Holiday;First time travelling to Bali with our 5 year old. Staying at Mecure Legian was great. The downstairs pool was very clean and great place to make new friends for us and him. The plunge pool room was large and very clean. We enjoyed the themed dinner on Tuesday nights with the Balanese dancers. The location is fantastic with lots around. Staff at Mecure were lovely and made us feel very welcome.

I have witnessed Hotels Limping through some tough financial times and others that have become pro active on the flip side. The Mercure Legian is one of my all time favourite destinations for many reasons, being its great location , quality rooms no most of all good service. Unfortunately this visit the ownership of the Hotel is not giving the staff the support req red to keep up the hotels high standards. The Hotel will be at 100% capacity tomorrow. The staff are undermanned, yet trying their best to give the customers the best possible service. The Hotel has no GM.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Hafidz L;Amazing service in an OK hotel;I was writing this review before check out. Stayed here with my wife and my 3 y.o boy. The hotel is O.K, the breakfast is O.K. No major minus, yet not an outstanding one. The reason why i gave 5 stars is because the way they respond to my family needs. The highlight is when the bring a new fridge from different floor because the minibar fridge in my my room is not working well while i need to keep milk for my boy there. At the same day, they also want to change my bedsheet in the afternoon because my boy accidentaly drop his milk on the bed. Amazing stay and will deff comeback.

I originally had booked another mercure property in Nusa Dua recommended by a friend. I arrived there late after a 6.5 hour flight from Melbourne. To my dismay I was given a dilapidated room with non functioning air conditioning despite being an Accor Platinum Member. The staff there was completely dismissive regarding my concerns. The next morning I decided I was not going to let this property r n my holiday. I phoned the Mercure Legian and asked to speak to the manager on duty. I was transferred to Yanty.

Very happy to see some smiling faces of the familiar staff we know and love . Missing front of house , reception staff , especially Anik and Dwi .

The super friendly staff makes each stay memorable and I am honoured each time I step foot at the hotel. The rooms are spectacular. I particularly love the Deluxe Room with Plunge Pool, as I take a dip every time I want in privacy. The hotel os eq pped with two fantastic pools (one open during the pandemic), a commendable gym (closed during the last time I stayed though), and is in an excellent location close to Kuta Beach, Seminyak, Sunset Road and Kerobokan.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Matias W;A solid 4-star hotel;A solid 4-star hotel overall. High quality beddings. Passionate and professional staff. Good size room. Warm relaxing decor. Excellent air circulation / central AC system. My room might req re a refresh as it has started struggling with wear-and-tear. Water pressure could've been improved. A bit disappointed with the way they handled their Internet breakdown. I couldn't blame the staff as they're perhaps bound by Mercure's own policy. While occupancy rate was low due to the pandemic, they seemed to struggle to find me an alternative room with a good working Internet. Having said that, I was sufficiently happy with the solution they provided.;4;0;0;0;0;0;1

My ALL benefit was easily recognized and fulfilled. Surprisingly I got complimentary of fresh slice fr ts which is perfect for hot weather in Bali. 2. Room I was staying in Room 106, and the room is pretty standard with other Mercure branded hotel. Almost squeaky clean but the glass table already shown wear and tear. Size is decent for solo/couple, however for parents who travels with kids, you might want to consider a bigger room.

Okay, so we moved on, and looked for something else... and here we are in Mercure. The pool was pretty standard. It’s a small pool, but inviting. The lounge chair was kinda dirty tho’ but nice.

A convenience store with ice cold Bintang and money changer right across the road. The Security station is right next to the ATM where you can withdraw $300 Aussie dollars. The staff are lovely and the breakfast each day is amazing. We had both lunches and dinners at the Hotel and every meal was faultless. We had a plunge pool room, the room was very spacious and immaculately clean. The water was a great temperature and very clean. The only downfall was when I turned the aircon off at night we found the room seemed q te damp the next morning. The hour massage was a pleasant surprise after a long day of travelling. We didn’t spend much time in the 2 outdoor pools but friends did and said the temp was great;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jess M;Overall Great Stay;Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Mercure Legian over Christmas 2019. I had a Balcony room on level 4 which was very clean and spacious. Pros: Room was clean and spacious, flat screen tv, safe and mini fridge available. Wonderful buffet breakfast, plenty of hot and cold options - though choose your timing wisely as you can be waiting for a table sometimes during busy periods. I also ate at the restaurant most nights and found a great selection to choose from, all food was delicious and came out q te fast. Both Pools are a good size, but not very large - generally the families and kids stayed downstairs and adults upstairs (some kid still come upstairs) though get in early in the morning to get a lounge bed in busy periods. Day Spa is well serviced, with 4-5 treatment rooms. I;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Christine J;Doesn’t disappoint;We stayed at this hotel last year so thought we’d try another Mecure in Bali at Kuta for a change - big mistake! We should have gone back to this one. After 3 days at the Mecure in Kuta, we cut our losses and moved to Mecure Legian. We had a balcony room overlooking the pool. The balcony had 2 chairs, table and a drying rack. The room was clean and comfortable, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom was well appointed with a nice hot shower. The staff extremely helpful and friendly, the breakfasts were fabulous, the pool area lovely, with shady trees. Highly recommend this hotel.;4;0;0;1;1;0;0

The staff were friendly and helpful, my room was lovely, spacious and spotless and the buffet breakfast was excellent. I only ever have my room serviced every 2-3 days and every day I left the do not disturb sign on my door I got a call that evening asking if I needed anything such as more complimentary water or shampoo etc., such nice little touches.Thank goodness the staff chased me down at breakfast after I had checked out having left my passport and cash in the room safe.

This place is all about the excellent staff who deserve 10/10. Everyone from housekeeping, security, pool staff, restaurants, travel info and front desk-and all in between - thank you. Place is a bit tired including bed linen and towels. Pool towels were all new day we left - so looks like that’s starting to get done. Two pools are fine with level one pool being bigger.

Our room was a balcony on L5, we had no trouble with noise. Enjoyed the use of both pools - although had to get in early for a bed on the rooftop pool. Service was amazing throughout our stay, very welcoming & nothing was a problem. We asked for extra pillows, got ice from the bar so could have some cold drinks in our room, they asked us how our room was & when I told them some minor things like sliding door was jamming, within an hour an guy was in our room fixing it. The location is very central - 5min to beach, great shopping near by & plenty of restaurants. Had 2 massages at the hotel was really nice.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Tijji;Great hotel in great location;"Stayed here for 5 days just after Christmas and over New Years. Check in was great. We arrived early so room was obviously not ready which was fine. Upon return in the afternoon, no issues with getting our room key. We had a ground floor room with plunge pool. Good size room. Usual bathroom amenities were provided (toothbrush, shaving kit, comb, vanity set etc). Breakfast was nice. Q te a variety. They had a small ""kids only"" section with 5-6 items which was a nice feel for the kids to made feel special at breakfast. Lower level pool was nice. However I think there were not enough day beds for the size of the hotel. If you weren't at the pool by 10, it was hard to find spot to sit. Roof too pool was nice. However, we did not use the pool as our friends who arrived a few days";4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Andre E;Very conveniently situated;The Mercure Legian Kuta . Very conveniently situated hotel. Right on the crossroads between Kuta , Legian and Seminyak. Though this hotel is close to a busy intersection it is surprisingly tranq l inside. The rooms are clean neat and practical. They also have a safe and fridge. The staff were always friendly and attentive. The breakfast was good with a very interesting selection of jams. My only criticism is that the coffee making facility uses plastic 'stirring sticks ' rather than reusable metal spoons. This hotel is most definitely recommend .;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Ellen P;Great in all ways;I & my big family stayed a few nights here during our year end holiday. It is located within walking distance to legian beach where the new year fireworks are held. Just opposite is a street lined with shops, as well as a minimart selling various drinks. It is also within walking distance to a number of nice eateries. It has 2 swimming pools, on the ground floor & 4th floor which is located besides the gym. I personally prefer the pool on the 4th floor becoz it is not as crowded as the one on the ground floor. The breakfast is great, both in terms of variety & taste. The bedrooms are clean & staffs are courteous. Highly recommended;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

The rooms were clean and spacious and perfect for my short stay here. The breakfast selection is done well and typical of a 4 star hotel. You have a choice of two pools, up on the fourth floor overlooking the streetscape with a pleasant area for lounging around, and a smaller but pleasant pool surrounded by palms trees on the ground floor beside the restaurant. The location is also great if you don't mind being away from the beach a bit, with plenty of bars and restaurants on your doorstep. This hotel definitely offers good value if you're;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Check In/ Out were smooth and q ck, the front desk team was friendly, welcoming and helpful. Room was clean and well-maintained, housekeeping and maintenance team did a good job. The corner unit is q te near to the main road, can be ""noisy"" at night, but not an issue for me as I am not a light sleeper. Room was spacious (for the price), well furnished.

Clean and basic. Breakfast was included and had everything you need. I did not try out the pool but it looked pretty small/average compared to a resort. I tried a massage at the spa and thoroughly enjoyed. There are lots of taxis pulling into the hotel or on the street. Try and get a metered taxi as they are WAY more cheaper than negotiating with a non-taxi.;4;1;0;0;0;1;0

Me, my partner and our 2 sons (4 & 11) got a family room and was really nice, clean and plenty of space. Everyone was extremely pleasant and helpful, from Reception, to the Life Guards, Concierge, Luggage handlers, Restaurant staff, Security and cleaners. Kids loved the pools, I liked the gym, even though it is small, you have to work with what you got. Breakfast was really nice with a lot of different varieties of food available. Everything you need is close by and walking distance or a cheap taxi or bike ride away. It can be noisy with the outside traffic but I didn't mind it. Would definitely stay again!!

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Renee D;Nice Hotel;We stayed here in one of the family rooms for 6 nights. Room was clean however a little old. Breakfast was great large selection of food to choose from and meals at the restaurant were very nice and not to expensive. Downstairs pool was great especially for kids. We didn’t use the upstairs pool as it seemed more for adults. Fantastic location with 100% Gen ne Fake Shop 2 minutes walk away, Legian Food Court was a 10 minute walk away and great for nice, cheap food. Would cost us about $15-$20 for 2 adults, 1 teenager and a 6yo with a couple of beers. Only downside was they were replacing the deck around the pool so while you could still use it, it could get a little noisy. We would definitely stay here again.;4;1;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Tayla M;Nice hotel with great location and breakfast.;Our stay overall was great. The location in Legian was really convenient, breakfast offered a large range of options (including Gluten Free), rooms were lovely and clean. The only downfall is that because it is q te a large hotel group, we felt that it lost the 'Bali friendliness touch' that you get at the smaller hotels.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;gmtaylor888;Mercure Legian;Special thanks to Mellissa. What a fantastic lady, always trying to make things just perfect for your holiday. Always recommend this hotel to friends and can wait to return. Nice position. The food is really good and the facilities are excellent (although the upstairs pool could use a re grout) This hotel is well managed as the staff are one big team. Looking forward to next time.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Trudi0;Q ck Business Trip;What an ideal hotel for a q ck business trip. Staff were absolutely wonderful - could not do enough. Two worth mentioning were Parjaya and Ratna (apologies for any incorrect spelling) and Guest Services Manager. Unfortunately I did not get to enjoy a lot of the facilities but what I did experience was fantastic. Pool area is intimate and enough to cool yourself off after a day out shopping or sightseeing. Great selection of menu items to choose from and in room dining is available. I was afforded a lovely room with a huge balcony overlooking the pool and this served as a great relaxation area after work. Bathroom is well appointed and had a lovely big shower with good water pressure. Bed was comfy my only comment would be the pillows, totally serviceable but I did miss;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Kylie G;Nice hotel - well priced;Nice hotel, very clean. I normally stay near the beach so this was different for me to not see the ocean. I picked it because of the balcony infinity pool. It is not huge but it was never that full. We also selected a deluxe room with balcony and we ended up with one looking at reception so we asked to move which they did no questions asked. If you want a specific view I suggest you ask for it at booking as a lot of the balconies look at nothing. Breakfast was really good. I have also always stayed at way more expensive hotels so if I had to fault this place I would simply say attention to detail, very small things. There was no face washers in the room, the coat hangers were broken. We walked our own bags to the room no one offerred to take them. While they cleaned every day;4;0;0;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Amykateb;Helpful friendly staff;Stayed for just over a week with a group of family and friends. The hotel is very clean tidy and has just about everything you need. All staff very friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. The spa is amazing, so peace and relaxing considering it is overlooking the main road. The upstairs pool is great however has no shade at all and the glass really needs a clean as you can’t see through it. The downstairs pool is amazing, thoroughly enjoyed watching the sq rrels play in the trees while eating breakfast. If I go back to Bali I will stay here again.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;MVIC A;A Favourite with Families;I had a very large and comfortable room, with 2 balconies and double sinks in the bathroom. There was also a complementary fr t platter in the room when I arrived. Everything was clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast had plenty of variety, although it was a bit crowded around 8am. The hotel is conveniently located and only a short walk to Legian beach.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Bruno035;Just like home.;I’ve written many reviews of this Hotel and I will continue to do so when I get such outstanding service day in and day out. I have developed many personal relationships with a whole range of the staff from junior members up to the GM. You don’t have to spend big bucks to get a good Hotel with excellent service. The location is without peer in Legian, being on the corner of Legian and Melasti Streets. Giving 4 ways to go and not stuck in a one way only Street. 2 Pools with casual dining on the 4th floor pool and Bar. Plenty of Theme night dinners. Nice Spa. I choose the Plunge Pool Room for that little bit more luxury. Once again many thanks to Melisa, Sunia, Wayan and the Big O. See you all again in February.😎🏊🤙🏼;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Colleen c;Time away;Great place to stay in Legion, conveniently located. Staff are very professional and happy to help with any needs from putting your umbrella up or delivering food and drinks around the pool. 4th floor pool is great, a bigger pool on ground floor however we did not venture there. Breakfast was great every morning, lunch and dinner were fine and bar snacks were delicious, especially the steak sandwich. Rooms were well cleaned every day and overall the hotel is still in good condition after nearly 5 years. It was surprising to see a few staff still there that were there when it opened and even more surprising that they remember you. I will definitely return again;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;briggs_03;Mercure magic;We recently stayed at this hotel on a mother daughter trip. The hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of Legian. It is a short stroll to the beach, and very close to local market’s. The hotel itself is lovely with all the usual amenities. There are two pools, one up stairs which can get q te hot during the day but lovely of an evening, and a downstairs pool which is more family oriented as it is q te shaded. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an Executive S te however it was too noisy being located on the corner of a major intersection, so we asked to be relocated to a smaller room overlooking the pool. This room was great, it had a large balcony with an outdoor lounge and day bed. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, they were extremely accommodating.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;SandiGail;Great experience!;We booked Mercure Bali Legian through a package we bought for a week in Bali. Since we arrived late at night we wanted our first hotel to be the near airport which Mercure was about a 20 minute drive. We were greeted by a very friendly staff who welcomed us with a flavorful j ce. The rooms were clean and very modern. The hotel is in a central location to the shopping area around Legian and a 10 minute walk to the beach with tons of restaurants near by. There is a money exchange right across the street from the hotel which we appreciated not having to find an ATM. Breakfast was included in package which had a variety of different foods to choose from. Overall our experience was great and I would recommend this location.;4;0;1;1;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;ruk;location 5 stars;based in Kuta the location of this hotel is great. stone throws away from many restaurants, bars and spas. Just opposite the hotel there is a convenience store opened 24 hours plus a reputed money changer. The hotel facilities were good considering the price point. staff were very friendly as well. Our room was based on the 5th floor and as it was a corner room it had a larger balcony than most rooms in the deluxe category. I would have preferred a more varied buffet tho. If you stayed at the hotel for some time the menus tend to get a bit repetitive..;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Sucipto S;Centrally located hotel;Stayed here 2 night during last visit to Bali, the location was great..

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Pamela;Fantastic Hotel;This was my first holiday as a single mum with my 2 sons 7yrs and 3.5yrs. We had a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a nice, clean, western style hotel. This was my 12th trip to Bali in 15yrs. I have stayed at many different types of accomodation including villa's, family compounds, small balinese hotels, 5 star hotels and mid range hotels. Our room was clean, the grounds were well maintained. The internet was fantastic. The daily clean of our room was as expected. Some of the rooms are a little noisy. We had a level 2 room at the front of the hotel next to the road and heard motor bikes all day and night. We moved to another room on the 4th floor overlooking the pool. It was much q eter. If you want to sleep during;5;0;0;0;0;1;1

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Minka_R;Do yourself a favour grab the deal on scoopon and stay in the plunge pool room;So this is the second time we have stayed at the Mercure. This time we booked the plunge room via a scoopon deal and would thoroughly recommend the stay. The staff were friendly and very helpful when ever we had an issue, it was dealt with q ckly and no fuss. Rooms clean and tidy. The only downside I found both this time and on our last visit is the dinner. The breakfast is plentiful and ok but we had three free dinners with our voucher and thought we would give it a try. I have to say this would have to have been the biggest downside to the hotel. All in all if your not going to eat at the hotel (which we never do otherwise) then this is a great hotel. Great location. Would stay again;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Lionel W;Enjoyable stay.;Staff were very good and location is good...close to some of our favourite places to eat and drink. (Pad bar and Jokers). Had a voucher deal which included an airport transfer and a drink each night as well as three meals. The meals were all good and had a cocktail each night at the roof top bar. A traditional night with dinner was very good and a fun night. The room was good however the balcony had palms growing up right in front, blocking the view which did not make it appealing. Breakfast was excellent. My wife however was not happy with the quality of the linen and advised the reception on our departure. She was however very happy with the massage, manicures and pedicures at the hotel. We did enjoy our stay here and the location as I said is very good.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Foxie2828;Plunge Pool;Awesome hotel in the middle of Legian. Amazing staff more than willing to help and always happy.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Russell B;Great central location;The hotel is only 5 years old, so everything is modern, clean and works properly. Attentive, friendly staff. Step onto the footpath, straight into all the action, yet it's not noisy at night. There are men on both of the roads to help you cross if the daytime traffic intimidates you. $2 taxi / Go-Jek ride to Kuta or Seminyak. Good breakfast spread and reasonable restaurant menu. Good air conditioning. Iron and ironing board are tiny and need to be ordered from reception (free) but there's not one assigned to the room. Good family-friendly feel. Pools and bars nice. Comfortable bed, plenty of bottled water supplied free, security safe. Bar fridge in room, with two little convenience stores for beers or whatever straight across the road.;5;0;0;1;0;0;1

The pool if eq p with floats and beach ball. That's superb! My kids love it! Only thing is we have to get the pool towel card to exchange for towel.

The hotel itself is a more modern style offering but very clean and a good layout. The breakfast matches and beats most places we have stayed at in the past, I rate it as very very good. They even have Vegemite for us aussies. We had a room with Plunge pool which was as big a room as we have had in Bali. Again clean and well kept. Plunge pool surrounds offered table and chair and also double sunlounge area. The privacy was almost complete but still allowed us to enjoy all day and night. Would definitely go back and would recommend this place to anyone that does not;4;0;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Hot100;Wonderful Mercure Bali Legian;Choose this property despite the other Accor properties nearby and I was glad i did. Very resort like. Was given the deluxe room on level 5 and the spacious balcony overlooked the swimming pool and bar. Activities began early in the morning, with fabulous music that accompanied the aqua aerobics classes. The swimming pool on the ground level caters to mostly for families with children. Located next to the hotel restaurant that serves breakfast daily. All in all, good stay and I'm not hesitant to come back.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;slwityk;First stay at the Mecure Legian.;Recommended by friends who stay here a lot so being Accor club members decided to try it. Hotel is large and very busy. We were given a room with morning sun and asked that it be changed so we could get afternoon sun, and even though we had to wait a while, room was changed. Nice bar, two pools, cafe shop and very large restaurant. We were on a package which included some meals on a limited menu. Meals were huge, and when asked if we could order smaller answer was no! Ordered dessert with one meal and in the section we sat in wasn't busy - left after waiting for 20 minutes. We don't usually go to Bali in July/August, (wait until the end of the year) and won't do that again. Staff very good, but housekeeping limited English.

However there are a few issues which could be improved: Pros: Lovely staff including but not limited to Ciltra for her always smiling face and introducing us to the benefits of Accorplus Melisa for her willingness to listen to our comments/concerns Feri, Made, Adi, Ela and others which I apologise for forgetting their names for their great service in the Ancak Restaurant Chefs for their lovely food Good value especially for the food quality served Efficient and friendly service Great location - 10mins walk to beach, plenty of places to eat, laundry nearby Cons: Busy area - high traffic, not for people who want to relax Upgrades - We understand that upgrades are subject to availability,;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jodie K;Great;Love the Mercure great location walking distance from everything. The staff are fantastic very helpful if you need anything..... The only problem I have with the Mercure is there fridges don’t get cold;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;swayamk2016;Very good;"We stayed in the Deluxe Room with Plunge Pool for 4 days and (because of a flight-delay) Superior Room for 1 day in August 2019. Extremely happy with the hygiene, service and also with the resolution of certain minor issues which came up. Amazing breakfast options; overall great food. Overall very satisfied. Tip 1: Book your spa well in advance - something we didn't do and had to regret. Had to go outdoors. Tip 2: There are two pools but both can get a little crowded. Time your swim accordingly.";4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Joe H;Scoopon Family Holiday;We stayed at the Mercure for 7 nights as part of a Scoopon package. Overall the stay was good and the motel is located right in the middle of the action of Legian. The staff are all friendly and the breakfast has enough variety. Some things that we didn’t really like: -there were no opening windows or balcony on the room. This made it q te stuffy in there and very difficult to dry swimmers. -the pool on the ground floor is the only one s ted to kids. However there is only sun in the afternoon and the water is q te cold.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;smalone2019;We loved it!;Great room, great service and excellent breakfast spread. Everyone there made us feel most welcome.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Molly317;Great Location;We stayed at the Mercure as a party of 12 for our daughters Wedding. All guests were arriving at different times throughout the week. We all had different rooms on different floors. I do agree with others that check in was a little lengthy especially after a long flight you just want a q cker process. Staff were very welcoming & helpful during our stay. Breakfast was great every morning although very busy they managed to keep up not a problem. Egg Station staff also made great Omelettes. Our room was on the fifth floor over looking the pool, music i dont think was necessary to be blasting as there were varities of people that were laying there. And Im sure the music wasnt to everyones tastes. Our door leading to the balcony couldve been alot better, it didnt lock properly & you;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Choong Wai S;Pleasant Stay, Highly Recommended!;Location: Although is a bit away from Kuta Beach, the area is full of restaurants/ eateries, shops and entertainments! Near to Seminyak and Kuta, convenient for GoJak-ing. Room: Well maintained, clean, comfortable. The balcony is a nice place to relax. Good sleep quality. House keeping and maintenance team is doing a really good job. Food: The breakfast and dinner at the restaurant were good, reasonably priced. Received good and warm service in the restaurant. Check In/ Out: Smooth, receptionists were friendly, helpful and professional. CAUTIONS: If you sleep early at night, it might be a bit noisy for you as the traffic can be heard (but again, who is going to sleep early in Bali?! LOL);5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Linda H;Great customer service;Booked a Deluxe King Balcony room as the pictures showed lovely outlook and reviews were very positive. When we arrived we were at first very happy with a clean and comfortable room but disappointed with a very noisy and uninviting outlook from our balcony, and a poor working cooler instead of a fridge. On reporting our disappointment regarding our balcony and our expectations regarding the hotel and it's rooms we were contacted by the lovely Melisa from guest services who was very attentive, listened to our concerns and arranged for us to move to an equally comfortable room with a much better appointed balcony which we used every day and evening, and a refrigerator. She checked in on us throughout our stay to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. Staff are lovely, professional;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Peter D;Excellent;Stayed here with my 2 lads for nearly 2 weeks, everything was as good as expected all the staff were exceptional as the Balinese people are, room was very clean had everything you expect, housekeeping was great always did a great job, pool areas brilliant, gym was limited but if you knew what you were doing you could get a full workout with what they had, breakfast each morning was excellent, the themed dinner nights could definitely be improved, there wasnt much choice of food and at 195rp($20 aus) was cheaper to go somewhere else for more choice, that was the only gripe, everything excellent, location of hotel is probably one of the best, secure money changer across the road is so convenient as with Atms, definitely would stay here again, i will be back next year lol;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Meagan R;Amazing hotel 10/10;This is our 10th time to bali and have stayed in many places. Only once we have had to move hotels... this one however the Mercure hands down is my favourite. We have stayed in Kuta and Legian so many times. But this one I felt was my favourite. The upstairs roof top pool is soo cool with dj playing music in the Arvos. The staff were soo lovely, the rooms were great, not to small for superior room, aircon perfect, bit cold sometimes but no it was amazing. The buffet breakfast every morning was so yum and had so much to choose from. All the staff are so welcoming and always saying sorry when it was busy around certain times. I didn’t have one problem while there. Thankyou Mercure we will defiantly be coming back to this one soon. We love bali so much. Thankyou.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Stu B;Would return!;Had a very pleasant staynin the Mercure Legian. It's located in a very convenient location to the beach, shops etc - in the think of it really! Good security, ATMs, excellent laundry opposite, circle k opposite - so everything you need extremely close. The staff were excellent: friendly and polite at all times. A good variety at breakfast, and although busy due to it being peak season, was replenished q ckly. Both pools are nice, although you struggle to get a bed after 10:00 on the four floor pool. Rooms were clean, bed comfortable and the shower good. Would return for sure. Things to improve: lighting a little dull in the rooms, more seating around the pool areas and plate warmers for hot food in the breakfast area.;4;0;1;0;0;1;1

As for the location, this is a great location if you like the hustle and bustle as soon as you step out onto the street, it's a walking distance to the beach, to the main Kuta club strip and you can even walk to Seminyak.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Kevin P;Solid Bali 4 Star;Location is good if you are not worried about staying close to the beach, which is 5-10 minute walk away depending on how q ckly you move. We had a 4th floor room with balcony, looking down on the ground floor pool, bed was very comfortable and housekeeping reasonable. Traffic noise from below was very noticeable especially when sitting around the 4th floor pool, though this is understandable given how very busy the surrounding streets are. Staff on the whole are good, there were a few minor issues at times but nothing to get too stressed over. Breakfast was pretty good, the usual resort style offerings, however there were just a few times when basic staples of the breakfast spread were not replenished for a while - eg.hot water for tea, scrambled eggs and self sliced bread for;4;0;1;1;0;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;addy g;Good hospitality and nice hotel;Everything are good, but a little maintenance for bathroom cause when we take a bath, the water not properly good. The breakfast are good and many variety of food and of course bread, egg station, salad, etc;5;0;0;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Bernadette Y;A short getaway;Location - good location, not too crowded and less than a 10 mins walk to the beach. Surrounded by restaurants Being Gold status - we were upgraded to a s te - it was okay but we found the room a little dim. Also the pillows were a little soft. Breakfast - this was our 2nd stay but we felt that the breakfast was just so so - although breakfast was included in our room rate, we chose to walk to Pullman Legian as the spread was better and nicer Pool - the pool on the 4th floor was crowded - difficult to get sunbeds One staff that I would like to mention is Priscilla - she was cheerful, she remembered us from our last trip in March and surprised us with an anniversary cake;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jonathon2014;Great for Families;I was traveling as a single mature male. Airport pickup[a must for me] waiting even though baggage took 75mins. Lovely smiling receptionist, easy check-in until--a different room to what I thought I had booked-a corner executive s te. Was told that all executive s tes are different so if you want the very large one as in the website, be aware. The first one was half the size of 255. Luckily it was available so no problems to change me as I don't know what I would have done if it wasn't. 255 was perfect with a large balcony overlooking a busy intersection. Traffic noise doesn't bother me, but some it might. All the staff for the entire 10 days were polite, friendly and smiling-from the guards on duty to the domestic staff. My s te was always cleaned before noon so no coming;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Alex 65;Excellent Hotel;Mercure Legian is right up there as a great place to stay.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;GnFTaylor;Family holiday in Legian;Nice hotel in a great location, short walk to Garlic lane and the beach. Plenty to choose from at the breakfast buffet and keep an eye out for the little sq rrel that lives in the old tree between the restaurant and the pool. There are two pools, one shallow pool on the ground floor which is ideal for the young kids and a second small pool up on the fourth floor. Neither are huge and there’s no swim up bar but they are sufficient to cool off on a hot day plus they have a DJ on Saturday and Wednesday afternoons which creates a nice adult atmosphere around the upstairs pool. Rooms are clean (we had two adjoining rooms - one for the kids) and cleaned daily (late afternoon for us). We did experience some early morning noise several times but I think we were above a conference room;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Rochelle J;Nice hotel, good location;This is a BIG hotel- it has lots of rooms and levels. Reception gets busy at check-in (first hotel out of 11 stays in Bali where we weren't shown to our room or offered help to take our bags to our room -which was a huge maze type walk from reception). The room was clean and spacious with a really nice bathroom. We had a balcony with a slightly noisy (yet interesting) view to the street and the pool. We actually enjoyed watching the people and traffic go by from many stories high and even watched a cremation ceremony parade from our balcony. The Mecure in Legian has a great breakfast with more choices than many hotels. Good location and convenient walking distance to both Kuta and Legian.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Ryan F;Fantastic hotel!;We stayed for 5 nights and were very happy with everything. We'd booked a room with a balcony and the first room we were given faced the (busy) street, so with a toddler who has daytime naps we asked for a different room. It was no trouble for the amazing staff to relocate us to another room with a balcony (which overlooked the pool on the 4th level) as well as move all our gear, including a portable cot. The facilities are great, including two pools and a nice restaurant which serves a fantastic buffet breakfast every day. We only had dinner there on one night (preferring to explore other options in the local area) and the food was great, although the servings were on the small side. The location is very central, with the beach only a 10 min walk away (on the same street as;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

The complimentary waters were glass though with long necks that dont lay down in the fridge too well, plastic would be much better.Room service was good, they promptly changed our fridge and tv that stopped working.

This hotel is seriously the best value for money hotel in Bali in my opinion. Its location, service, food and facilities are bang on. The dinner menu has plenty of options and with the 50% for Accor members its unbelievable value. The vegetarian burger, spring rolls and potato croquets are delicious. Perfect for the upstairs pool area with a beer. Best vegetarian spring rolls ever btw..The Italian restaurant right across the road is the perfect go to when you need a q et night, next door to that is a brand new circle K to stock up on the beers and snacks. Its a 10 minute walk to the beach, about a 15 min walk to the Sky garden nightclub. We were upgraded to room 269 which has a massive balcony with day bed and couches etc. Love this;5;1;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;fredrikn262;Nice place in a decent location;The hotel is well kept and the rooms are large and nice. We had balcony which makes a difference. The bummer was that we had rooms facing the street. Since the action goes on until early morning it’s fairly noisy. I live in a city so it did not bother me too much. The area is, as I understand, low key in comparison to Kuta, but I don’t see that as a downside. It’s a short and cheap taxi ride from 24/7 partying, walking distance from the beach and heaps of restaurants, bars and shopping within walking distance.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Coleen;Lovely hotel with amazing staff!;We had a 10 day stay at Mercure Legian and I have to say although Legian is a hub of activity and q te noisy our stay at Mercure was very relaxing and refreshing. We had our breakfast included every day and it was very delicious and fresh. The rooms are spacious and clean and beds are comfortable. The restaurant is affordable and the drinks not too expensive just watch out for that 21% added to your bill (10-21% everywhere you go in Bali). It q ckly adds up and if you’re not careful everything looks very cheap till you pay your bill! ☺️ It was a lovely stay and we felt very special and cared for.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;H Shan;Beautiful Hotel;Liked the location and design of the hotel, however felt the lack of personal touch. There was no welcome letter of any sort, I had to either ask or research on my own for breakfast operating hours. Breakfast was good especially the egg station, massage was excellent and relaxing as my other half even snored halfway through the massage. Shower room cleanliness could be improved though.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jacinta M;Fantastic place to stay;In January 2019 I treated my mum and I to a 9 day mother/daughter trip to Bali. It was the first visit for both of us. The Mercure was fabulous. Yes the room smelt a little mouldy on arrival but we didn't notice it by the morning. Our room was cleaned everyday, and the staff were extremely accommodation when I hurt my back on day 3. The breakfast here is AMAZING. There is a choice of everything and if you like your eggs cooked fresh or fresh noodles or rice cooked then the chefs are happy to do so. There are 2 pools which are fantastic. Only a few chairs around them so during the warmer and busier parts of the day not everyone has some to sit. It's central location is fantastic with short easy walks to restaurants, beach, shops etc. Going back again I'm December this;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Simon G;Easter Holiday;First time to this hotel even though i have been past many times over the years. Booked it mainly because its very central to all the shops and restaurants. I booked an larger room with a balcony. Overall the room was fine and the balcony was good but it really overlooked the other hotels around so the view was average. The 2 main pools were small and with no swim up bar sort of lacked the atmosphere of other resorts i have stayed at. The staff were friendly as i have come to expect with all Bali hotels and my wife and i were always made to feel welcome. We would certainly stay again.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Harsha K;Good no-frills service;The hotel is very conveniently located in the heart of Legian and a short stroll away from Kuta. Checkin was a breeze even at 2:30 in the night. However the room service was a huge let down! :( Tried to call at 2:45 in the night since we were hungry after an unexpectedly long immigration queue wait. The night duty staff was perhaps fast asleep and no one answered our call and we had to sleep hungry. The mini-bar too was empty - not even a can of soft drink that could be charged later!!!! Apart from the unsavoury first night, the experience was pleasant overall- maybe because I didn’t expect too much from the hotel.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;darwin_john;"Great location; gimmick pool; pleasant stay";The Mercure Bali Legian Hotel is a comfortable, well priced, family friendly hotel in the heart of Legian in Bali. The hotel is modern and contemporary, however don’t go looking at attention to detail too closely, as you’ll q ckly find that some aspects leave a lot to be desired. The hotel is located on the bustling corner of Jalan Legian and Jalan Sriwijaya (which in turns flows on from Jalan Melasti to the West), being perhaps two of Legian’s busiest main roads, and is surrounded by all manner of convenience stores and restaurants, bars and tattoo parlours, souvenir shops and money exchanges. The central location can be a blessing or a curse, depending on one’s point of view. The main entrance is off Jalan Sriwijaya and it will take you about 20 to 30 minutes to reach the;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Osama A;Family hotel;Nice hotel and the staff are nice. The hotel in all the action in Legian and Kuta with walking distance. If you are traveling to enjoy the night life of Bali this is your hotel but if you want the beach it’s far away so this is not your hotel. Since I am gold member I was upgraded to a nice room with balcony. The room is nice but the only problem is you can hear the people walking outside. The breakfast is nice with almost everything you want. I enjoyed my stay and I would stay here again in the future if I want to be next to all the action.;4;0;0;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Rose G;NICE HOTEL;Stayed for a week here. Staff are very friendly and courteous. Our fridge was not working after 2 days so they replaced it within a couple of hours which was great. Room was average size but had a large balcony on the top floor. It is a bit noisy at night as you are right in the city or maybe a room at the back maybe q eter.The pool on the top floor was warm all the time not very refreshing. We used the pool on the bottom floor it was cooler and q eter. Would not stay again as we like to try different hotels. Breakfast was a wide variety of food.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;48mlee;Chillaxing and Shoptures and driver;One week only. Experienced so much and always happy to return to our comfortable hotel. Twin room shared with my son. Standard size so enough space for us. Clean and well arranged rooms. TV well situated and the good sized balcony gave us a view of distant mountains and the daily life of our neighbouring Balinese and their roosters. When you've had enough of the funky outdoor smells it's great to retreat to a comfy bed in the air conditioning and free wifi. The bathroom and toilet were combined and spacious enough. Don't drink water from the tap or shower. Keep your mouth closed when washing face and hair. I set up a pump water bottle system using cooled boiled water for teeth and face. Fresh bottled (330ml x 2) drinking water replaced daily was an added bonus and the buffet;4;0;0;0;0;1;1

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Bernadette Y;Location;"Good location - not too far from the airport. Hotel situated about 10 mins walk from the Legian beach and surrounded by massage and spa. Lots of restaurants around the area. We were greeted when we arrived and was given an upgrade (perhaps because of our GOLD status) and we welcomed it as it was a room with a ""plunge pool"". It came in handy as Bali was so hot. Breakfast was okay - not extensive but adequate. We bought the GOLD package for drinks but was disappointed as the fridge was not working well and hence no cold drinks. Bed was a tad too soft but was fixed when we feedback to the staff at reception. Not enough hangars and the shower screen door did not close fully (Room 127) Overall, we had a pleasant stay and would definitely come back to this hotel again. Thank you";4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;ptk123;Excellent staff, rooms and facilities.;I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel at the end of March 2019. Luckily, i was able to stay at another hotel in Legian (recommended by flight centre) prior to arriving to the Mercure, as this allowed me to realise what a huge jump in value the Mercure is. Conveniently located, excellent staff on all levels. breakfast and restaurant were good and so were the swimming pools. I ended up getting very badly hurt on a scooter during my stay here, and the team looked after me incredibly well. From the two gentlemen that drove me to the hospital and stayed with me, to the housekeeping, maintenance and restaurant staff who helped me around the hotel and offered to send food to my room. Just a note to all travellers, Legian/Kuta is INCREDIBLY unsafe at night. This is of course no;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Had to keep asking for water, toiletries, coffee and tea to be refreshed after they cleaned room everyday. Breakfast was ok but need more variety. Gets a bit 'same same' everyday. Staff seemed confused as to what was included with breakfast. Every time you would ask someone you would get a different answer. Bali night in Restaurant was very ordinary. Food was cold and very bland. Requested q et room away from roadside, checked about location and told q et room when checking in, but room was located beside roadside. Asked to move after having no sleep first night. Have stayed in many Accor hotels as Silver member. Don't know if I'd stay here again. Certainly no Accor member;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Missjbc;Happy stay at Mecure Legian.;The Mecure is a great hotel in the heart of all the things you could want in Bali. Our room was spacious and cleaned well every day. We were happy in our room. Breakfast has plenty of choice. I do have a comment though about the candles burning at breakfast eg the 4 yoghurt pots had a candle burning in the middle of them which made the yoghurt warm. Several places at the buffet had this and the serving spoon was hot to handle. Only a small thing but I thought this unnecessary near food as there was no purpose for the candles other than ambience. Could also become a hazard if someone knocked them as they were the wick in the liq d. Staff were always welcoming and friendly. I had several massages which I can highly recommend. We enjoyed the lower pool rather than the rooftop;4;0;0;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Ashleigh C;Great Location;First stay here at Mercure Legian. We stayed in the family room. Great little room :) We loved the downstairs pool. Especially at breakfast. Kids being kids eat barely anything and want to swim so we can enjoy our breakfast while the kids swim in the pool. Breakfast was a nice and tasty. Great location... bmc across the road Yes Spa close by and Azul and the beach just down the road. We are Accor Plus members and get discounts so we had a couple of meals at Ancak. Slow service some days... Our room also didn’t get cleaned one of the nights. I mentioned in emails before we came we were celebrating our 5 year anniversary but didn’t get a mention. Not deal breakers but def lost 5/5 points instead of the 4 I am giving it. All in all it was a great hotel for the price.;4;1;1;0;0;0;0

Our First room was far to noise and after we negotiate we where upgrade to Plunge pool room which well and truly made up for it. Although we weren't expecting great things at Breakfast given it a Mercure of which we have stay in a few around the world on our trip in 2017. It did offer enough but its a bitty the coffee and j ces aren't a little better. The only day we used the pool we where lucky because we went early as there is a lack of pool chairs around the top pool.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;WalkoJ;Accommodation;Thanks to all the staff at the Mercure Bali Legian Hotel ! This is my first post for you guys, I thought it was time I wrote a review for you. I have been a regular visitor to your hotel since you opened, I think it is about 5yrs ago now but who’s counting, up to 6 times a year, staying for weeks on end. My wife and I feel it is our second home outside of Brisbane Australia. You treat us like family and give us the royal treatment each stay, it would be impossible to think of staying anywhere else. We travel a lot around the world but have never found a hotel like yours. Where do I start to thank individual staff members for your friendship over the years, you are all so special. So many good staff at one hotel it’s a credit to all of you. These are just a few that come to;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

The staff are wonderful especially Melisa, upgrade on arrival and the during our stay she followed up on how our room was and greeted us by name and all the staff are always friendly and smiling and happy to help. We were also lucky enough to get a late checkout. The ceremony/parade with the Ogoh Ogoh on Nyepi eve that they had in the lobby was great to watch and be a part of. The buffet lunch they had on Nyepi day was yum and a lot of choice. Then the two hour massage on the afternoon was heaven! It’s in a great location for everything shops, beach restaurants etc!!

Their breakfast buffet has a fantastic selection of foods and always been restocked so you never miss out. We also had dinner and cocktails at the hotel three times during our stay and were equally impressed with the standard of the food and service.It was a bit unfortunate that the decking on the first floor pool area was been replaced so that pool was closed but good news it was finished 2 days before we had to leave and it looks great.;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Elaine K;Good 4 Star Hotel in bustling street;We recently stayed for 7 nights in a Deluxe Room with Plunge Pool. So here's the review on various points: Room - Very spacious at 64sqm, definitely didn't feel cramped. Good in-room Wifi, full range of toiletries replenished daily, coffee/tea making facility, robe, slippers, in room safe. It also has pool towels replenished daily for the plunge pool. Pool itself is q te small but it's more for relaxing and chilling rather than doing laps. If the pool had a view it would have been nice but I guess the walls around it was for privacy as the room is on the ground floor. Comfy bed, and you can't hear street noise when sliding door is shut. The shower cubicle had a wind up curtain if you choose to see through or not. Some maintenance req red as the shower cubicle door;4;0;0;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Lazylizard61;Q et haven in a busy area;The Mercure Bali Legian is a q et haven in a very noisy, busy part of Bali. Check in was excellent and the staff very helpful. The pool was lovely but too warm to be refreshing and the outdoor areas of the hotel were spotless. My room was clean and fresh and overlooked the pool from the 3rd floor, which was nice. I told a staff member why I was staying, and they enq red after my daughters health each day when they saw me.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;thesigno4;Really enjoyed our stay here;It was our 1st trip to Bali. I decided to go here because it looked good, was in between Kuta and Seminiyak and I found a voucher on Scoopon for $829 7 days which included a deluxe room accommodation, daily breakfast, 3 dinners, a massage each, one drink each daily ie: beer or cocktail (limited choices) airport pick up and 1pm check out that we extended for a small price. I was a bit hesitant to purchase a voucher, thinking it was too good to be true, but turned out to be a great decision. As soon as I booked through Scoopon the Mecure wrote to me to confirm. The only regret is I paid extra for a balcony and shouldn't have bothered as the balcony overlooked a wall not a view and anyone could walk past us as it had a gate. I did mention this to the hotel and they immediately;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Sherbert903;Comfortable but needs some work;My partner and I stayed here as part of a cheap package deal. The room we were put in was a basic room with a view of the pool which we requested. We felt a bit claustrophobic in this room so requested to be changed to a room on the 5th floor (this is the top floor) with a balcony overlooking the 4th floor pool. This was much better and having the balcony is great to be able to dry wet clothes and to just generally chill out. So I would recommend an upgrade to this. Rooms are clean and comfortable. There is not much storage in the bathroom. We also had trouble with the shower handles which kept falling off and you could hear people in other rooms had the same issue as theirs would fall off too. It makes a loud banging when it falls off, maintenance staff need to check these in;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;mostlyharmless;warm service, adequate rooms;A one night stay, in the standard rooms. Check in was simple and fast. Rooms were a little small (for two persons) but adequate for a short stay. Rooms at the rear have an undisting shed view, but rooms overlooking the 4th floor pool may be blighted by music from the poolbar. The best rooms are probably those overlooking the ground floor pool. All mod cons in the room, but minor niggles included a shower head that was floppy and wouldn't stay in position (making for a frustrating shower experience), and a leaking sink. There is no rainfall shower, as you might surmise. The 4th floor pool was small and q te a heatsink in the afternoon, and fronted by music from the bar.

This was nice, however the music coming from the pool was sometimes loud and irritating. The staff showed gen ne Balinese politeness and courtesy and were lovely to my partner and I during our stay. The food was good, don’t expect anything amazing but the few meals we ate in were edible and affordable. While the location was central it was a bit too far south to walk to the fancy restaurants and beach clubs in Seminyak and just within walking distance to the Kuta Bars. The only major concern of ours was the cleanliness of the shower in our room with mould growing in the grout of the tiles.

Night was great because you can get a bit more cosy. Room service was q ck and food was sensational. Regardless of what we ordered it was fantastic. Service and staff were also excellent. Gym was also sufficient as it wasn't heavily utilised. There are 2 seperate pools which was also great as kiddies tend to stick with the shallower one next to the restaurant.

What attracted my when it opened was its position on the intersection of Legian and Melasti Streets. You can walk anywhere, including the beach. And take a taxi or a grab usually in under a minute front the front of the Hotel. I book the Plunge Pool room for its bigger size a bit of privacy in the pool. Sonia and Wayan cover the good service and tasty food very well. With my favourite Guest Relation Manager Melisa always making sure she and her staff take very good care of me.

The breakfast is great: tip of the trip, you can order Eggs Benedict at the omelette counter. We had to up grade to a family room when we got there. I misunderstood what a twin room was. I thought it was two double beds. It turned out for the best as we had lots of room compared to the standard room. Money changers are across the room, as is a laundry service and there is a mini supermarket to the left of the money changers that has cheap groceries: coke, chips, chocolate, all the important things on a holiday. This hotel is perfect for a first trip to Bali. We also went to two buffets in the evenings. The Monday buffet was great: authentic Indonesian food with music and dancing.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Brendan B;Good price hotel im legian;Very good choice of hotel whem staying in legian. Rooms are bigger then typical mercures, very clean and the location is at the heart of Legian.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Sunshine62112455225;Beautiful hotel & wonderful staff;My partner and I stayed for ten days at the Mecure Legian - a beautiful hotel with everything in walking distance or a shirt Blue Bord taxi ride away. The staff are so accommodating and eager to help on any way they can, be it advice on excursions, local restaurants or general info about the hotel itself. The pools are immaculate and the staff are always on hand to ensure you have plenty of refreshments! Also, the air con our room was like heaven after a stroll to the shops in the Bali heat! Can not fault our stay whatsoever! The room was immaculate and clean linen, towels and tea/coffee were always provided in ample supply! There was even a mini sewing kit which came in handy when my bikini strap came loose! We honestly can’t wait for the chance to return and the Mecure Legian;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Tegan;Great Stay!;Just got back from a lovely week spent at the Mercure Legian! We stayed in a superior room (be aware that this room doesn't have a balcony) which was a good size and also very clean and fresh. However, I would opt for a balcony room next time so that I could sit outside and not have to get a lounge by the pool to do so. The facilities are good. Two nice pools, the downstairs one is good because it gets some nice shade most of the day. The pools aren't very deep about 1.2m the whole length of each of them. We never really had a problem finding a free lounge by the pool, but that could be the time of year. We had the breakfast each morning and thought it was good (fr t cereals, toast, bacon, pancakes/waffles, Indonesian foods, eggs station). The location is great. It's a 10;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;MrsMBallarat;Another Great Stay;The Mecure legian is in a very convient location to Kuta and Seminyak you gets the best of both areas with this easy to get to motel. Its not a 5 star hotel but it does not pretend to be. Rooms are very clean and its very safe and well appointed. the food is clean and safe with plenty of options nearby for other restaurants. There is a money changer across the road, circle K short distance and plently of shops both braded and market. A 8 minute walk to beach with a slow dawdel q cker if you are. We have chosen to stay here a few times at the start and end of a trip to Bali due to its easy to get to location late at night and for early flight departures. My only critique would be that there are not many sunbeds around the ground level pool and bugger all shade / umbrellas;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Christopher N;Plunge pool room;Outstanding room, service and staff. We never went to either hotel pools because we absolutely loved our own private plunge pool just 2 steps from our room door. This is the only way to go 😀😀😀. The hotel location is brilliant only a short stroll to shopping, beach, restaurant and bars. 💯% we will stay here again & again. Thank you Mercure 👍👍👍;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Food in the restaurant was fantastic and we were lucky enough to be staying at the hotel for their Halloween celebrations - what a fantastic evening. The hotel is close to shops, the beach and the Beachwalk Mall. Would definitely stay here again.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Pepo G;Best Hotel ever stayed;I stayed 12 lovely nights in this hotel with my wife and we can absolutelly recommend it to everyone visiting to Bali. The hotel staff is the most professional I have ever seen and always smiling and very kind. Rooms are worth to pay the extra charge for balcony. Room and bed was comfortable and well-appointed. Pools are a good place for relaxing and cooling down. Breakfast was also nice as well as the night events, dinners organized by the hotel. One piece of neg point is the hotel location. The traffic is almost all the time crowded but less hornings comparing to India. Overall a good hotel with the best hotel staff. Thank you for everything.;5;0;0;1;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Syu;Good stay;We requested a connecting room and even though one of the room was not ready by check-in time at 2pm, the staffs were very accommodating and tried their best to make our stay as wonderful as possible. The location is wonderful with food, spas, atms all within walking distance and is not costly to go to most attractions via Go-Jek. The rooms were well-maintained except that there are lots of mosq tos and the hotel does not provide Bygone. Special thanks to Feby at Reception and all staffs by the pool. they’re always polite and made sure you enjoyed your time at the hotel. Will be back for sure.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;SteveG23;Central Stay and Clean;Great hotel in the midst of a good part of Legian with plenty of shops, food and places to visit. The hotel is very clean, modern and the staff were exceptional. We had a problem with our TV and management made sure it was fixed immediately. Great gym area for those that want to work out with treadmills, free weights and a few machines. Both pools were fantastic, we preferred the roof top as it got more sun, music was pumping and great life guard Kris on duty. Rooms were good for a family of four... however i recommend if you are travelling with children try to get a balcony. Our room had no open windows/balcony - so it was hard to hang up clothes/bathers. Even a clothes rack would've been handy. Buffet breakfast was fantastic and wide variety to keep everyone happy.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Michael D;A CONVENIENT CORNER;The Mercure Legian never fails to impress me. It is well positioned close to all amenities and the beach, the rooms are well appointed with 2 pools and the entire hotel has an open feeling. Bali is a hive for tourists and there are many places to stay if one is looking for a convenient place that is Legian just out of Kuta next door to Semiyak look no further. Importantly the hospitality of the staff is exceptional they are the true difference at this establishment. From the moment you walk in Melissa & Fanny do an exceptional job as guest relations always doing their utmost to meet customer expectations. The morning breakfast rush hours have Putra and his team handle it with a deft touch. They do an excellent job making sure the guests are well card for. Chef Wayan Sugiarta;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;60darrenp;Fantastic hotel;This was our first time to stay here and from the moment we arrived until we left we was treated exceptional by every team member. As a AccorHotels Platinum member I felt like we was staying in a Sofitel and not a Mercure. The room was wonderful and modern. Checkin was fast and efficient. What stood out in this hotel was the restaurant and bar staff. They made our 7 day stay special as they gen nely took care of us.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;ellea352;Fabulous hotel with great service;We chose the Mercure because of its location and contemporary style of hotel. We opted for a room with a plunge pool and it did not disappoint. Service was great, hotel offered wide choice of fresh food and the staff could not do enough for you. We were told that the noise from the traffic on the road would be distracting but to be honest it we really didn’t notice and we didn’t hear anything from our room. Rooftop pool area was smaller than we thought, Not a great deal of space for loungers but sufficient seating area for a drink or two! Taxis were easy to come by. Security always on hand to call a cab if you didn’t want to hail a cab yourself. Overall a great hotel which I would recommend to others.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Mt4n0t0;Loving it;I like the room it feels warm. The service was beyond great... I requested a baby crib on my reservation, and tada... The baby crib was already set in our rooms, and eventhough the crib is part of the service and its free... the hotel also provide me with additional complimentary drink. It is really beyond my expectation. When we entered the room it was already cold, I really felt welcome. When i called to borrow plates and cutlerries so i can feed my hugry kids, within minutes they arrived. seriously.. it was soo fast... My cranky kids didn't even have the chance to throw tantrums...

Very friendly and welcoming staff. Main photo is misleading as there’s a b lding in front of that pool and traffic below so it’s not as peaceful as the photo implies. Delicious breakfast with plenty of choice. Wish the pool was open longer and prefer the second floor pool as it’s calmer than downstairs. Was swimming in the ground floor pool and staff just started packing away and told me it was closed 10 minutes before the actual time, not relaxing at all.

Good range of food, fr t, pastry’s, j ces etc. Coffee machine not the best and didn’t work most of the time. 2 swimming pools ground level and 4th floor.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Leeniepigs;Comfortable stay, Great location and friendly service;I enjoyed my first stay with the hotel however my second stay of 5 nights was not as great when compared. The location of the hotel is fantastic, with shops and art markets nearby and the beach is about 100m away. The location is pretty safe even to stroll at night and there is also a laundry place nearby. The room this time round was disappointing as the television channels hangs frequently, I had to call for help more than twice and the third time, no help came. The floor felt sandy even after housekeeping and no face towels were provided during my entire stay. I initially thought they do not provide other towels other than bath towels due to some environmentally friendly motion, however I came to realize that they do still provide. Though the room was q re a disappointment,;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Chris W;Lovely first few days in Bali;We booked earlier in the year and paid around £37 a night. Booked for 4 nights. The hotel was around 10 minutes walk from the beach. We found most of the things we wanted to do we’re in Seminyak so got a lot of taxis. Prices ranged from 50-70k rupiah. Later found out about an app called Grab which is like Uber. You save a lot of money. We had a superior room on the 3rd floor which was clean and modern. It was cleaned daily. House keeping were hit and miss with towels and bath mats. We requested an iron which was q ckly delivered. There was no balcony which was disappointing but not the end of the world.

I’ve had many trips to Bali and stayed at many hotels there but The Mecure is high on my return list. With all the noise and music outside my room blocked it out, the room was very modern as well.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;HayesNZ;Excellent stay. Friendly hotel.;We had a very pleasant stay here. The staff were so friendly and helpful. That applies to all areas of the hotel. There are two pools and at times a sunny spot can be hard to get, but in such warm weather the shaded spots are still nice. Food and drinks were reasonably good value. The location is good - lots of nice restaurants and bars nearby, plus a short walk to the beach. Very good value overall. We would happily stay here again.;5;1;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;catherine w;Thanks again;Two weeks at Mecure Bali Legian . Wonderful stay once again and Thankyou to all the staff who make it so special for us . Especially Ella and Rai in the restaurant Also at reception is Anik who goes out of her way to help us with anything we need . We experienced at least half a dozen after shocks from the Earthquake and we still felt very safe at Mecure Bali Legian . Needless to say we will be back again soon , See you all next time and keep up the good work;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Angnev62;Good value for money;Clean and comfortable hotel, friendly staff, great rooftop bar, nice breakfast, I was only there for one night but would return, best money changer across the road and handy to everything. The only thing I can say that needs improving is the rooms need to have a card in the rooms with what to do in an earthquake/tsunami - I was woken up on the Sunday night just before midnight when a 6.9 earthquake struck Lombok and it was very strong in Legian, children were screaming in the hallways and people evacuated downstairs, there was no direction from staff with what to do & it felt like you were on your own, perhaps they need an earthquake evacuation point sign and a flyer in the information book in the room;5;0;0;1;0;1;0

Our room was great (214), we had asked for a q et one and yes it was-- on the inside facing the pool so no road noise. The shower was powerful and the bed was amazing. Air-con good.

We were both thrilled to arrive into our hotel room & find a beautiful anniversary cake plus the morning of my birthday the restaurant staff sang ""Happy birthday""to me & presented me with another beautiful cake. Every staff member with whom we came in contact was attentive & kind. Especially, we would like to acknowledge one of your employees who was outstanding & very helpful during our stay.

Once our rooms were ready we were informed and I arrived in my room to find my luggage already there along with a welcome plate of fr t.The first time I stayed I went for the 'Executive S te with Balcony' which was amazing, very large at 60sq metres and with everything you could need including a lounge area with another TV.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Morgan;Great stay, good aircon, awesome breakfast!;We stayed 4 nights here as a couple and paid around $100 per night including breakfast. Check in was super easy and staff are very lovely, got to our room which was nice and air-conditioned and facilities were great. Only small things were there was mould around the sink, mould on the shower curtain and the mini fridge made annoying noises sometimes but you just needed to tap it and it would be fine. I spoke to a lovely lady called Melissa who said she would have the fridge changed but it didn't bother us that much. Also the cleaners did a great job at changing the sheets but there are two decorative silk pillows they put back onto the bed everytime where the pillow cases don't get changed and they are leaning up on the fresh linen so I think that was a bit gross.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;DWSAHperth;Holiday Break;This Hotel is in a great location ( for us ) access to the hotel for taxi's etc is good as not all streets 1 way. The hotel is clean & tidy & most staff friendly. Our 1st room was on the 5th floor overlooking the main road ( big mistake ) great room with 90 deg balcony but the noise from the traffic was unbearable. we had 3 sleepless nights until we were finally moved away from the noise. Our new room was great & we enjoyed the rest of our stay. Breakfast was good, hotel ambience also good. More detail to room by cleaning staff needs attention, it took 7 nights before we received hand & face towels in our room ( only after complaining to guest manager). would we stay here again, yes but only if we can get a room away from traffic noise.;4;0;0;0;0;1;0

Room service was fantastic and all the staff were extremely friendly and fun to talk too, they gave us so many great recommendations for dinner or attractions! There are two main pools, one that gets the sun all day and the other has more shade, Theres an ok little fitness room and a nice spa treatment area, the 1hr massages were amazing!

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;MJCR2014;Value for money;We stayed here for a few days in July with family. There are two pools and the hotel is within a 5 minute walk of the beach. The hotel is exceptionally clean and spotless. We ate at the hotel and the food was really tasty and reasonable. The only problem with the one pool is that people leave their towels on beds to keep the beds but are rarely there. At check out someone signed something to our room, so maybe management could review these aspects.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Bruno035;Very 😎 return customer.;As a repeat guest who has been coming here since its opening. I have witnessed nearly all the bugs being ironed out. It now runs seamlessly. We recently had our Daughters wedding reception by the pool on the 4th floor and what great service we received, to have a truly memorable event. The Hotel is very reasonably priced for a 4 Star property with service that was actually better than we received at the Sofitel for the preceding 3 nights. I am curious to read some of the negative comments on TripAdvisor. With guests complaining about paying deposits for in house charges. The Hotels policy is Accor wide, unfortunately not all guests are honest in this world we live. Also about the difficulty of getting a deck chair by one of the 2 pools, there are peak periods so get off your;5;1;0;1;0;0;0

Break fast was great, staff in general very friendly and helpful especially the pool area. Pros Location New Modern Great service Security Cons Check in slow We found the checkin process very slow, eg 4 staff, with 2 of them serving, 2 just doing nothing when other customers waiting up to 10 mins to checkin is not the best.

Hotel staff, Fani, told us this is special for my first trip to Bali which is my best customer service experienced ever. The room is super comfy and clean especially private plunge pool. Very enjoyable! I love it! I recommended this hotel and plunge pool room. Worth experience! The outdoor pools and restaurants are great as the standard.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;GregAussie1;Not bad;The Mercure Bali Legian hotel is certainly in a great location. The restaurant is good, gym and 2 pools. A large hotel but easy to stay at, couple, single or family. The staff were very helpful and friendly and top marks to the staff that cleaned the rooms. Thank you. The room I had was on the street side and noisy. Not a big problem for me but if you need your sleep make sure you get a room away from the street. This hotel is close to everything, you can walk everywhere or easy to get a taxi or motorbike. I thought it was just a little expensive on comparison, but just a little. If you choose this hotel I don’t think you would be upset. I enjoyed my stay in spite of the noise. I will say I don’t think other wings would have this problem. Enjoy Bali.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

Very reasonably priced and you can't beat the location. Walking distance to everywhere! Rooms were small but clean and modern, bed was comfy and room had everything we needed. Breakfast was awesome - massive buffet that was included in the room cost. Two pools to choose from - ground floor that's very shaded if you don't like the hot sun (used predominantly by families) and a roof top pool that was smaller but not many kids used it. My only gripe with our stay here was the lack of sun lounges by the roof top pool. You had to be q ck to get one. Staff were incredible everywhere in the hotel. The security guards at the gate were so friendly and polite and Cris at the upstairs pool remembered everyone's name. All in all a great stay and we can't;5;1;1;0;0;0;0

Staff were very friendly but unfortunately simple request for things like milk or an iron were ignored. After multiple requests I gave up. Resort is very untrusting req ring $80 room deposit and when your bill goes over $80 you have to go back to reception and top up with another $80. This made us actually stop eating at the resort as we got sick of lining up at reception to top up credit. Towels are thin and stained. Location is great.

Walking distance to Seminyak and Kuta which is great but when traffic us crazy. Hotel was really busy whilst we were there but service still at a high level. Rooms and bathroom really clean, housekeeping was great just a little late on high checkout days. Feedback on rooms, beds really comfortable but need drying racks for rooms without balcony (no where to hang wet bathers) and really need to update pillows, they were pretty sad. Overall, I'd stay again, 5 minutes to great eats, shopping and the beach.;4;0;1;0;0;1;1

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;phaTran;Great;THE LOCATION Close to the action but not smack bang in the middle of it, Mercure Bali Legian is surrounded by funky boutiques and bustling restaurants. THE SPACE Mercure Bali Legian owes its casually cool vibe to a neat and contemporary fit-out with bright pops of blue and green. For example, lush hanging gardens cascade down the facade of the interconnecting b ldings and tropical trees sprout in public garden spaces. The two pools (one on the ground floor and a rooftop-style pool on level four) add in another big dollop of aqua. Even the seats in the hotel restaurant – Ancak Restaurant and Lounge – come upholstered in soft shades of blue and green.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;brenny68;Worth every penny;Well we took this holiday stay as part of a Scoupon deal, mostly so our daughter and her friends could afford their part of the cost. So 7 days cost 799.00 AUD for two people and included 2 x massages each, 3 x 2 course meals and a daily each. Our first room was an adjoining room so we were woken up by a loud child, however they moved us immediately up to the fifth floor. Althoughthis was further away, you couldnt hear the traffic, so that was a bonus. The rooms are very clean and that is very important to me.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Raylene E;Great place to stay and to get to everything.;Great shopping on the way to /from bars, restaurants etc. On arrival the fridge did not keep cold very well and my comments were provided back to Expedia (who I had booked thru). Straight away Melisa ( Guest Manager) had arranged for the fridge to be replaced and also a issue with the TV repaired. Great service and the fridge was extra cold for the rest of our stay. We should have done this the first night and approved reception, but just thought the would have all been the same fridges due to the heat/humidity. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. The room was very clean and has a large shower/bathroom. Curtains had complete block out which made easy to sleep in. Breakfast was as expected with multiple choices but if you got down there after 9.00 am the choices were never;5;0;0;1;0;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;mrholiday2018;Great Location and Q et Rooms;We stayed at the Mercure Bali Legian during this trip to Bali, all hotel staff where always smiling and willing to take that extra step to help. We had a king room with a plunge pool we will defiantly be staying here again, and we will be getting the same room type only we will request one without balconies above. Only bad experience we had was other guests throwing lit cigarette butts from balconies above down to our pool, when we raised it with reception they appeared to be getting on to it but unfortunately it continued. It is just a shame that some people are pigs and are allowed to stay in nice places like this. Breakfast buffet has a wide variety to cater for all different requests, cook to order poached eggs are the go to. One thing that always made me smile was;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

The room was cleaned everyday and the bed was super comfortable. We stayed on the 4th floor which made it easy to have a drink at the bar or sit at the pool. The only downside was our mini fridge was not cold so there was no point in buying drinks. Apart from that everything else was great!;4;0;0;1;0;0;1

The room was lovely, clean and comfortable. We found the location to be perfect for our needs and while the street noise was able to be heard in our room which was close to the front of the hotel, it did not disturb us when sleeping and the bed was very comfortable. Not usually pool-goers, we did venture a dip in the ground floor pool early evening on a couple of occasions when it was q et and thoroughly enjoyed it, that ancient tree poolside is magnificent! Staff at all points of contact were friendly, helpful and efficient. Could not fault it.;5;0;1;0;0;1;1

Being allergic to gluten (coeliac) it often is difficult to find food in foreign countries that aren't always as educated in food intolerances, but the Mercure provided Gluten-Free bread for me at breakfast and there was always more than enough GF options to chose from. the hotel room was beautiful we had a Deluxe King Room overlooking the pool and were not dissappointed.

The bed is comfy, firm but not too hard, clean modern bathrooms, and TV has good reception. The Pool upstairs is so great, so many cosy couches and sunbeds to chill on, pretty trees and lamps hanging from them, cool tunes playing all day too and lovely pool staff, I'm literally at the pool all day everyday ! The downstairs pool is very relaxing, probably a better choice if you have kids. All in all this is now my #1 choice for my yearly Bali trip !;5;0;0;1;0;1;1

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;955scott;Great Hotel and Staff;Service and Staff were great! The only thing we didn’t enjoy was the mould smell in our room and obvious water leak that had caused it.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Fiona;Value for money!;We have been to Bali many times and usually stay on the beach at the Pullman. We are Accor members so had b lt up a fair few points. We thought we’d try something a bit different/cheaper and stay at the Mercure Legian. Using our Accor points, we got 3 nights incl breakfast and an airport pickup for just over $100 which we thought was a bargain!! We weren’t expecting much as it was only a four star hotel and thought the location would be a bit out of the way. WE WERE WRONG. The location was great - a five to ten minute walk to the beach, lots of restaurants nearby and shops galore. The pools are stunning! The lower pool had a kids pool attached and they supply a few different floaters. The pool on fourth floor is cool, but obviously you don’t get a nice view like that of the;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

The breakfast is awesome! and they have their special local food which is chef recommended during breakfast! The only downside of our stay is during the check-in. We wait 1 hour to get our room ready and the saddest part there's no enough chairs/seat for your guest while waiting. (l'm standing). Overall we have a good stay in this hotel and planning to come back again in June! See you all soon!!!;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;anjeevl;Lovely hotel;Had a great stay at Mercure Bali Legian. Stayed for 6 nights. Rooms where clean and well serviced. Modern hotel with staff that are very friendly. My only issue is that my room should have had an extractor fan for the shower. I was otherwise extremely satisfied with the hotel. The breakfast was excellent. Only had dinner there twice and it was good. Had the suckling pig the one night for dinner and it was excellent. The hotel is well positioned and within walking distance to the beach and some lovely restaurants. Foreign exchange is across the road and is a legal one. Starbucks is a 5min walk. Was most impressed with the staff and their friendliness. Its what makes you want to stay there again.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Shambles;Nothing wrong... would stay again;For the price this was a great hotel. Great breakfast (apart from the sultanas in the pancakes), great pools, really helpful and friendly staff. It is in a great location. Easy to walk to popular places, good food nearby, easy to catch a taxi outside. There is also a money changer across the road that won’t rip you off. The hotel just lacked a few things. Our room was q te big but lacked anywhere to hang wet clothes. It also lacked a light bright enough to see what you are doing at night time. The room was illuminated by lamps only. The air con we had in our room was on for 7 days straight at the coldest setting but there were times we would wake up hot. It seemed to struggle to keep the room cool. All in all I would tell friends to stay here and would stay here again;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Kevin Kelly;Location is perfect;Stay here in late March 2018, for 2 nights. Got a better deal from OTA than from the hotel itself. Check in process is good, but the problem is the room is not ready yet. We arrive at 3 pm after a long journey from Gili, and we need a rest. Other than that problem, everything is going smooth and perfect. Location is I like the best, the Legian/Seminyak area which is not very crowded as near the Ground Zero, but still not too far from ground Zero. There is 2 way entrance/exit way via Legian Street and Sriwijaya street, so you have option to avoid the traffic jam whic is more chaostic in Bali these day. Room is big size, bathroom also enough space. The bed is comfy and huge. The complimentary water for drink is just too small, only 330ml x 2 bottles per day. Welcome drink is many;5;0;1;0;1;0;1

The rooms and facilities are always well maintained. The breakfast buffet was also delicious with many varieties. The location is also good to walk around and they have ATM machines at their premises. The only small thing which was a little issue to me is that it's a non smoking hotel.

The best my partner ever had.They really deliver an excellent service. There are two beautiful swimming pools with perfect warm water. The one downstairs surrounded by trees is a peaceful haven. The rooftop one is more exposed to the sun and it gave us a great feeling of being surrounded by the city buzz. Breakfast had lots of options and we really enjoyed the fried rice and the Balinese coffee. We only stayed for two nights but they were worth every minute.

We had the local rooster wake us up right on 6am. The room was away from the road so no road noise. I did consider asking to move rooms but the bed was very comfy and I could sit on my balcony and have my music going and didn’t interrupt anyone... the main pool was fine and the service of cocktails etc was great. Happy hr 4-7 was good value. We had tea in the restaurant and couldn’t recommend it enough. I had the chicken and my daughter had the curry. 👍👍👍. Overall it was a great stay.

We were able to use a restaurant, spa, pool, gym, pay TV and Wi-Fi. Small hotels did not have internet on that day. The only complain is that there were not enough chairs around the pool for everyone, but it is understandable as everyone had to stay inside the hotel that day. At 6pm everything stopped working and the light at corridors was switched off. I stayed in a standard room without a balcony. The room is good size, modern and spacious. However, shower had a problem as the water did not drain properly and the floor was dangerously slippery inside. The bathroom had an unpleasant smell and there is nowhere to dry swimwear.

Top tip: if you want more exposure to the sun, the pool on level 4 is the way to go. The room we had on level 5 was peaceful and q et.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;I’s Eyes;Skilled staff;This hotel's staff are very professional. They are not only friendly but also hard workers which is very rare in this island sometimes.. Fani, one of the elite member's desk staff, she was remembering me even though my last stay in this hotel was 2 years ago. She also remember my preference so she kept and arranged my favourite room for me. Not only the room but also everything here while I was staying like I don't need to say anything but she already arranged what I want. Thanks to her, I was enjoyed Ogoh-ogoh festival for the first night and Nyepi Balinese silence day for the 2nd day and night. I'll definitely be coming back for the next year!

Last time we got a balcony room on corner of the top floor overlooking the street and pool. It was a bit noisy due to traffic but we decided we’d definitely stay again as everything else was fantastic. This year, we again booked a balcony room. Upon checkin we discovered we’d been placed in a room overlooking the busy Legian street which is on the outside of the resort. I asked if it were possible to get a q eter, pool view room and can happily say we were then given a room on the fourth floor overlooking the main pool. Absolutely perfect. It wasn’t close to the road so traffic noise was no issue at all. Breakfast is a fantastic buffet and staff are always so friendly and helpful. Free yoga and aqua aerobics are;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;taldar769;Not good enough for a Mercure hotel;Hotel is centrally location with numerous shops and restaurants in all directions. No complaints with room or staff. I do however have a complaint with management. I arrived late and having to wait 15 minutes at reception to register was unacceptable. While waiting, no one offered apologies and it was as though I did not exist. Not good enough for a Mercure hotel.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;brettjenny1;Value for money;The Mecure is a awesome place to stay. Clean, nice breakfast, friendly staff. We would stay here again. My only complaint would be our room was made up late each day but the staff done their best and it was not a big issue.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;3amigosFranksten;Fantastic!;Great location, very clean rooms and the service was amazing! The poolside was very relaxing and again, the service amazing!

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;colagirl;Good location;The hotel is in a great location. The commonwealth bank is next door and the beach is a few minutes walk from the beach. The hotel has two pools which were fantastic. I had breakfast there every morning which was top notch and had a wide variety. The only draw back was they could do with new hotel sheets and towels. They were clean, just a bit old. Overall I had a great time and would stay again.;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Trek668012;Holiday with group of friends;Very relaxing, good food good service, highly recommended. The pool is great, warm & clean.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;AcuraMelody;Nice hotel & good location;Stay here for 3D2N and fully satisfied with the hotel. The room provided to me earlier is not the one that I had book and I have requested to change room. The front desk staff was friendly and able to change for me but not the room I booked since most of it is under maintenance. I stay in a normal room and they upgraded me to plunge pool room the next day. The hotel is clean and have a lot of food selection. The pool was good and s table for children. They also have kids club where my child enjoy it a lot. The location is good and legian street is just corner from the hotel. Easy beach and convenient stall access. Surely will be back again;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jan M;Great hotel, terrific location;The hotel is situated on Legian street, centrally located near just about anything interesting in Kuta. The hotel is recent, q te big, nice size rooms, though if you have no balcony, you can’t open a window... as a result the room is q te humid (both due to the showers and air conditioners) The bed and bathroom are very good, the tv offers HBO and Fox. The hotel has 2 pools, the one downstairs mostly frequented by your parents with kids, on the 4th floor there’s a second one, more hip and with lounge area and bar. The food is varied and very good. The staff is very friendly and helpful.;4;0;0;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Fran F;Great Hotel;We loved this hotel. It is the second time we have stayed here and it is great. The room is spacious with a balcony that overlooks the pool area The fridge could have been colder, but we have never found a cold fridge in any hotel room in all the times we have been to Bali. The staff were great and in particular Surti and Septia who served us in the dining room;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;helen388;Happy holiday;We love the Mercure Bali it’s a great hotel with all the facilities you need for a wonderful relaxing holiday. It’s central location makes it easy to walk to the beach, restaurants and of course many shops. For information on tours there’s a tour g de located in the lobby and we found that very helpful. The best of all has to be the staff they are so warm and welcoming and made our stay truly enjoyable;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;rayj1011;it is just so good;I have stayed at this hotel several times and will continue to stay here when in Bali. it is so reliable, same friendly staff, great rooms, tremendous value and you cannot find a better location. there are two great pools, restaurant and bar and everything is so easy.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Amir H;A pleasant stay with family;It was a nice hotel for those who likes to stay in Bali with their family, especially if you bring your kids. The hotel staff are helpful and nice, the pool area also enjoyable for my 1 yo 4 mo baby. The Hotel also q te walkable if you want to go to legian beach. I also recommend to try their restaurant, their meals are great, I loved their immunizer j ce. One thing I dislike of this hotel was during I experiencing their pick up services on airport, the driver seems doesn't care that we bring along a baby, he drives very speedy and makes us have a car sickness;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;CKZ05;Well-priced and well-located;Mercure Legian had just opened so we grabbed an amazingly cheap deal. Up to the Mercure standard - rooms were clean and comfortable which is always what you want. The pool was really small compared to pictures and not so glamorous. The pool area is moderately small with sun lounges and a couple of double cabanas. Happy hour at the pool was great. The rooms were really modern and sized well. There was no off street noise and it is a busy area. Walking distance to Legian Beach, lots of Legian shops, spas, salons etc and a short walk to Kuta if that's your thing. For the price this is certainly a good property for those not wanting to stay in Kuta but wanting to be close to the buzzing centre. I would probably not recommend it for families or honeymooners but for friends;4;1;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Eve B;FOURTH STAY AT MERCURE LEGIAN IN 2 YEARS;Returned to Mercure one again. Noticed one big change from our last 3 visits & that was new addition of air-con to restaurant which was very welcoming. Made it much more pleasant to eat there. Had dinner there one night which was good. Also tried the BBQ buffet dinner by Rooftop pool which was excellent. Much better than last time, the meat, chicken, fish was cooked to perfection. Good singer entertained us as well which made for an enjoyable night. Tried a couples massage too at hotel which was good. Would have liked the room to have a more Balinese look to it. Breakfast was good & even though it was very busy there was never a long wait at the egg station. Room good, cleaned well, air con really good. Overall an enjoyable stay.;4;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Hiba H;Great location!;This hotel is in the heart of Legian, close to night life, cafes and restaurants as well as discovery and beach walk mall.

Rooms are nice and breakfast buffet is alright but very clean and comfortable rooms.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;James T;Very pleasantly surprised!;My partner and I were in Perth (Australia) visiting my parents when we decided to do a spontaneous short trip to Bali. We booked the trip last minute, and having visited Bali before, we opted for less glamorous, cheaper accommodation over more activities. Mercure Hotels have a very standard, somewhat generic reputation in Australia, so I wasn't expecting too much, but we were so surprised and thrilled with level of service and amenities at this hotel. It is a cut above the rest of the Mercure Hotel group, and has the look and feel of a more prestigious resort. The aesthetic is subdued and classic yet has a modern edge, softened by tropical plants, and the sound of waterfalls. There are 2 heated pools, one an infinity 'Garden Pool' adjacent to the restaurant, and another on;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Chris K;Great hotel;First time we have stayed at this hotel. What a find. Great location, friendly staff, good clean rooms, great breakfast.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Elvis1408;Excellent hotel in Legian 5⭐️;My family and I have stayed for the 5th time in total at Mercure Legian, this time from 10th to 24th February 2018 and have enjoyed every stay and we plan many more trips to this beautiful hotel. Mercure Legian is a excellent hotel,great roof top pool chill area , even better landscaped pool on the ground level, good breakfast ,and close to amenities and a short stroll to Legian beach. The Mercure Legian location is great one side Seminyak and other side Kuta , (close to malls , shops and restaurants/bars) which is one of the reasons we like staying here. Staff are all helpful and I specially like to mention Guess Relation Officer Bulan Maulidya for her outstanding professionalism and willingness to help her customers. Thank you again Mercure Legian staff for making my stay;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;mattdavo;Great value for money;Always a pleasure to stay at the Mercure. It's in a great location being a short stroll to the beach, garlic lane and plenty of good eateries only a stone throw away. Highlight of staying here is always the staff. They are friendly, attentive, helpful and great with our kids. The rooms are of adequate size, nothing fancy but just right for a comfortable getaway. The pool areas are great but particularly like the atmosphere around the infinity pool area where it's a perfect location to enjoy a cocktail or Bintang. Have stayed a numerous places in Bali and this is one of our favourites.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

The room was great not huge but hey we only slept there , it was clean and well payed out , the hotel has 2pools top one on level 4 great , how ever we opted for ground floor pool as it was cooler , the top pool can be a bit warm to swim in .

Very central location shopping at your door literally , many great places to eat close by . Fantastic money changer BMC directly across the road , they even stop the traffic for you to cross .

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Caitlin;Beautiful hotel, relaxing stay;First and foremost I'd like to note that the breakfast buffet at Mercure Legian was top-notch. There were plenty of Western options as well as local c sine. It was a really great way to start each day in this beautiful hotel. The staff were very attentive and friendly. The two swimming pools are well-maintained and very relaxing. The gym was large and had great, modern eq pment. The hotel room was a bit shabby (rusty light fixtures, wallpaper peeling in places) but overall very clean and spacious. Bathroom amenities were plentiful and replenished every day. Wifi was solid and very good. The only downsides I can think of are the street noise and the tired decor.;4;0;0;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Debbie c;Great hotel Great stay;Our 4th visit to this hotel and won’t be our last. We had a great stay in a Delux pool facing room with balcony. The room was spacious and very clean. The balcony was great too. Breakfast was amazing, there is so much choice you can’t go wrong. The staff are alway helpful and very friendly. They just can’t do enough for you. We were made to feel like we were the only guests and nothing was too much trouble. The location is perfect to explore all the surrounding area. Look forward to our next visit.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Keenan K;Simple, Elegant, Family Friendly, Great Pools.;LOCATION: If it's your first time to Bali or perhaps you're just bad with geography - you have to understand that all the major tourist attractions like the elephant park, temples, quad-bike tours etc are REALLY REALLY FAR AWAY, especially if you're staying at Kuta, Legian etc. So prepare yourself for a LONG DRIVE. TRANSPORT: The current highway in and out of the airport (and nearby areas) is a NIGHTMARE. If it's your first time, the incessent badgering of people offering a taxi or to carry your bags can be a bit overwhelming. It's definitely worth it to book hotel transport to and from the airport as part of your room booking. Traffic is unpredictable, it can anywhere take 25-60min, so plan the rest of your day accordingly. HOTEL DRIVERS: We booked a massage/dinner over at;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Daniel R;Great location, Great Property, an asset to the Mercure brand;My wife and I recently selected this hotel for a mini-break, and I'm very glad we did. Check-in was very simple, and it was great to be greeted with a welcome drink before being shown to our room on the third floor (374). It was a Superior King Room, and was exceptionally spacious. It was great to find a room that provides an empty mini-bar fridge (with an option to purchase a mini-bar package) which can be filled from goods purchased elsewhere (including the mini-mart directly opposite the hotel). Water was also provided every day. There was plenty of storage space through the room, including hanging room in the closet, and we were thoroughly impressed with the range of television channels available on the TV. The blockout curtains were great in keeping the room dark;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Love their pools, even my son have some kind of ritual everyday, ground pool every morning and the 4th floor pool every evening. All the pool staffs is very pleasing and very helpful. Room is clean, everything works, housekeeping did a good job everyday. Food is good, breakfast just need to add more menu and variation. Location superb, walking distance to Kuta and Legian beaches, close to Beachwalk mall, 15 minutes to airport on normal traffic and its less than 1 US dollar using;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Petra;Location location;First time staying at Mercure Legian normally we stay at Novotel Nusa Dua. The hotel locatin was just perfect close to markets, beach, etc. Staff very helpful and they go out of their way to give exceptional service. The 1st floor pool was great and expecially the lifeguard that everday went out of his way to lend pool inflatables to the kids. The 4th floor pool is more for RnR and recharging the batteries especially with the pool bar. Breakfast is plentiful and lots of variety I loved the chef's special table. I would definately be coming back here again.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

The location is excellent right on Melasti St where we frequently shopped and ate at lots of the restaurants. We loved the pool on 4th floor. They also have a big pool on the 1st floor.

The hotel has good facilities with 2x pools, a spa (for massages, etc) and the restaurant. Our room was on the fourth floor and it was a good size, with a balcony. The buffet breakfasts served each morning were great - a good variety of breads, pastries, Indonesian food, fr ts, eggs, bacon, rice, pancakes, waffles, cereals etc. All of the staff were always very friendly and Kris (the lifeguard at the pool) was extremely welcoming and fun to be around! The hotel is positioned in a central location, near all of the shops and restaurants and within a 5 minute walk to Legian Beach. There is a money exchange place right across the road that is very good, and a laundry place just a few doors up from there - this;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

Each time we have been back the Mercure’s made positive improvements to their service for guests. They seem gen nely interested in what their guests think which is admirable. On leaving we were approached by front of desk and asked what we liked or didn’t like. Four of us stayed and once again enjoyed our visit. The pools at the hotel are great and staff very friendly. The breakfast is good and could probably improve a little. As Accor Hotel members we will definitely return. Thank you Mercure was again.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;YoungBek;Lovely large room;Pros: Clean, large room Plunge pool in room was great Breakfast was satisfactory with a wide range of foods Modern and fresh The window between the shower and room is great Location is good with lots of spas, shops, money changers etc around. Far enough away from the bustle of Kuta but close enough to still be amongst it all Cons: Towels, and robes are really old and need replacing Mosq toes around the plunge pool made swimming and sitting outside uncomfortable Breakfast staff are annoying with their keenness to take your plate or glass away as soon as you have the last mouthful of food or drink. The coffee machine makes a terrible coffee Overall, I would stay here again but I would choose a balcony room instead of the plunge pool if I were to return in the wet season.;4;0;0;0;0;1;0

We wanted extention till 4PM but manager were rigid not to do this. Though I'm a member plus my next stay in Yogyakarata is also in Accor group. I also shared my experience with Marriott group but they were tough on their stand.

The hotel is very clean and professionally run. Our room and ens te were fine, with enough room to set up a portacot for our baby (we ended up hiring a portacot from elsewhere as the ones the hotel provides are not great). We had our breakfast each day in the restaurant which was q te nice. There's also a bar next to the pool on level four which has some yummy snacks as well. The pool on the ground level is great for families. The hotel is not a resort, but is centrally located right next to Kuta, and a 10 minute walk from Legian Beach. We had an excellent stay. Thank you Mercure Bali Legian;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Doryxo;Awesome hotel. Even better staff!;Stayed here recently for a family holiday. The facilities are great. Two pools, cocktail bar on level 4. Try the beef hotdog for lunch, it's delicious. The staff were fantastic! From housekeeping through to front office. A big thanks to Melissa for the advice on where to eat. And to the head chef Wayan for the recommendation of a great Warrung to eat at! They were welcoming and even with our 6week old baby, they never hesitated to supply a fan for the restaurant etc. Great staff who even brought me food when I was struck down with Bali Belly! Much appreciated!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

I did not hear 1 complaint from any of them and every comment back to me and the Grooms parents were extremely positive. It’s time to hand out the individual compliments. First and foremost The GRM Melisa over the past 12 months who went far beyond the call of duty, for which we are very very grateful. Executive Chef Wayan and his team prepared a fantastic array of food for the wedding and the pre-wedding buffet a few nights before, once again many thanks.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;dbfun48;On sale it is good value but...;We chose to stay here as we received a sale fair that included breakfast and we also have advantage plus which made the restaurant cheap. Previously we had stayed in a pool room. The room is big but some of these rooms lack sun on the pool and it can be very cold swimming. We decided to take a balcony room. We were surprised how small they are. It has all you what. The balcony is fine for two but no more. The room has very little space other than the bed. Similarly the bathroom is small but is clean, with a good shower. The pools are nice, as they are shallow and warm. But they are too small with too view pool beds and too small an area around them for a hotel with so many guests. Restaurant food is good to very good. Breakfast though is just run of the mill average.;4;0;0;0;0;1;0

Highly recommend the Plunge Pool room for its size and having your own pool to swim in privacy. The plunge pool is a good size for two adults to cool off and relax. Very nice we would stay here again but next time longer.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Rands88;Best hotel in Bali!;We travelled to the Mercure Legian as a family (5 rooms in total) this week and we would definitely stay here again. This resort is a true 4-5 star, even by Australian standards. The location is very convenient - good restaurants within close proximity and away from the Seminyak traffic. There is also a small convenience store across the road. The hotel itself felt very safe and clean. There were always security and staff around to greet you with a smile. In addition, the hotel restaurant serves very good food (thank you to the tall Chef that made my fried tomatoes every day at breakfast). The beds are wonderful and the rooms/grounds are spotless. It is definitely the hard working and friendly staff that make this hotel first class. The staff here are extremely helpful -;5;0;1;1;0;0;1

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Chizzel;Staff are amazing;This is well located in Legian being not too far (walking distance) from the beach and central to good restaurants and shopping. Unfortunately the rooftop pool bar was shut for maintenance whilst we there. The noise from the work wasn’t too bad though. We aren't the type to complain for a room upgrade and understand that renovations need to continue regardless. It will look good when it’s finished. The rooms aren't overly big but enough for what you need. We were in a large group so we all usually ended up most evenings in one room, drinking and talking. We did get a sewerage smell coming from one of our rooms which we needed to ask for an air freshener. They sprayed some in the room but I was hoping that they would affix a freshener on the room or change the room. We ended;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;eccythump;Great location in the heart of Legian;Stayed here with a group of ladies for a week. The hotel is clean, secure and comfortable and what you expect from Mecure, but the best feature is the convenient location in the heart of Legian with a legitimate BMC money changer directly across the road (they even had a security guard stopping traffic for pedestrians) and a Commonwealth Bank branch and ATMs across the other road. Reception staff were helpful and friendly and all transactions were easy and accurate. The buffer breakfast was very good as were lunch meals poolside. I usually prefer hotels with more gardens so I was q te disappointed with the roof top pool which wasn’t at all like the promo picture, instead it was much smaller and all concrete without any shade or greenery.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Tracey J;Great stay;Travelled as two concerned mothers as sons in Bali for schoolies. Hotel was in a central location, was clean and the staff were lovely. The pool on level 4 was closed, for what looked like major renovation, but the ground floor pool was still great to cool down. Hi to life guard Kris, who made our time by the pool enjoyable with a friendly chat. Staff interaction is great especially when it's your first time to Bali. We had breakfast included and there was a wide choice - enjoyed poached eggs exactly as I like them. Money changer across the road, felt safe and exchange rate was comparable. Departing flights were cancelled due to volcanic ash and our stay was extended by two nights - which was no problem & handled efficiently by staff.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;The Travelling Familia;Nice place close to everything;Stayed for a week with the family. It was in a great location, close to everything and still private. The pool upstairs was not as child friendly, as there were more couples laying around. It was not huge and closed for repairs for a large part of our stay. The pool dowstairs was better for kids, however, the poolside service could have been better. The ladies at the massage shop across the road (forgot the name but they wear purple) were very nice and great with kids.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;kellib843;A safe, enjoyable stay;Mercure Bali Legian provided an extremely safe and clean environment for myself and my teenage daughter for our week long holiday. The room and bathroom were very clean and serviced to a high standard every day. The air conditioning, WiFi and tv with Sky channels were very much appreciated when the 33 degree heat was a bit much. We were really pleased that our accommodation package included the buffet breakfast as the choice was incredible and it was great to eat good food while planning our day via the WiFi. The fridge in our room meant we could keep drinks cold - very helpful. The two pools and the air conditioned gym were really great and well maintained. I found it helpful to book tours and activities via the agents who had desks in the hotel foyer as I felt safer utilising;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Firstly, the hotel is approx 2 years old so all the rooms and amenities are new. The staff are fantastic, the managers, in particular Melisa and Fani are very welcoming and make you feel like an appreciated loyal guest. The spa on the 4th floor is fantastic and the staff are very professional. We tried the 4 hands massage which was a great experience! The breakfast is one of the best in Bali, esp since they have pork bacon and sausage.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Lots of good restaurants, shops and amenities nearby Room was nicely furnished with a comfortable bed. Staff were great and helpful. Level 4 pool was clean and relaxing. A couple of small things that could have made the stay more pleasant - the fridge in the room (although on max) would not keep water cold! The buffet breakfast was very mediocre. Although not the hotel's fault, the street noise was q te loud at times (we asked for a pool side room with a balcony and was on level 5)......;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Turn off the air con and have the balcony doors open to nature I have also stayed in a plunge pool room before and absolutely loved it. A bit pricy so not every holiday but for a short stay I would certainly recommend it. Nothing better than floating in your own pool at midnight Staff are amazing.

At the Hotel around 1PM, i was not greeted very well, i have to ask first to get the staff attention (well this is considered rude for hospitality industry). The check-in time took q te long, me and my client have to wait about 1 Hour to get my room. I thought there are some confusion with my booking.

Ten minute walk to the beach and very close to Legian street (however I wouldn’t shop on Legian street, too expensive). The buffet breakfast was also really nice with plenty of options to chose from. Roof top pool is perfect to relax by, only issue was the limited shade near the pool.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Rodolfo P;Great Hotel;My stay in Mercure Bali Legian hotel was great, The whole hotel staff was friendly from the first to the last moment and specially Chatarina, the Guest relation officer, with her kindness and tips made my first visit to Bali unforgettable.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;75014PARIS;Perfectly situated at Legian;This Mercure is really nice and a great place to stay at Legian , plenty of massages and restaurants around , a very good laundry and bureau de change BMC across the street and only ten minutes from fabulous beach !;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Adrienne W;Good service;Airport pick up was great. Pleasant hotel with good service. Room comfortable and clean. A good starting point to expore more of Bali. Kuta is a busy place and the hotel provides a cool and relaxed atmosphere after a day at the beachor town. Very well located.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;gertiebraini;Great Location in Legian;We spent 9 nights at the Mecure. Room were spotless. Staff were very friendly. Food at the Hotel restaurant was delicious. Only complaint was that we asked for a late checkout on the day we were leaving as we had a late flight. We were told that our room was already booked for someone else and no other room was available so tried to book another Hotel for 8 hours. When looking online we discovered that there were rooms available which we ended up booking. I just wished that they had made this a little easier for us as I was willing to be charged for the other room and not expecting a freebie.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Ann-Marie C;Great Option for an overnight stay;We only ended up spending 6 hours in this hotel as we opted to check in here pending a late flight back to Australia. As far as value for money goes this is great hotel and option. We arrived earlier than the available check in time and were surprised when we could not only check in then, but we were also given a room upgrade to one with our own pool. The rooms are very spacious, great bathroom and whilst the pool is small, it certainly gives you another space. The staff were fantastic, food and drink options and service also good.;4;1;0;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;bullwinkle4;Overall great stay for many reasons;Booked a scoopon deal which was excellent value for money and hotel surpassed my expectations. All staff were very friendly and accommodating, nothing was too much trouble. Several times they welcomed feedback and actioned q ckly. We stayed one night at one of Nusa Dua's top rated resorts, but found our experience at Mercure Bali Legian more pleasant due to guest service. Due to central location (shops & 5 min walk to beach) there is general street noise but it would not deter me from recommending as that's just Bali!;5;1;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;bowereview;Leanne Bowe;The staff at the Mecure Legian were amazing. Went out of there way to help. Rooms were spotless and spacious.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;ioannou417;Excellent service, good value for money;When staying at the Legian Mercure you must bear in mind that this is a city hotel and not a beach resort. Although the rooms are well soundproofed, there is always going to be some traffic noise during the day.The hotel is very well situated in the middle of Legian with lots of night life and shopping around, and the famous Legian beach is but a short walk. The pools are q te big and ample for a city hotel, and the breakfast is very good. The rooms are q te spacious and the beds are very good. All in all ,very handy for exploring the city and excellent value for money.;4;1;0;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Yeh Rim K;Nice people and Nice place, and swimming pool is extremly excellent!!;I have spent 3 days and it was totally perfect and lovely! Peoples were kind, and all the facilities were clean and neat. Location was also excellent, and you could easily find small shops and restaurants nearby. Especially, there are two swimming pools, one in the garden and the other at the rooftop, amazing and beautiful! Wanna spend my holidays again in Mercure Bali Legian!!;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Mark R;Great visit on a great deal;4 of us stayed here on a voucher deal for 8nights. An amazing stay , the staff never let us down. 3lunches 2 massages 7drinks and breakfast everyday included. An amazing deal and even when i used the last lunch on the final day after check out time the staff still accepted it no questions asked. The location is perfect just a few hundred metres from beach and garlic lane area, 1km approx from kuta central and bordwalk shopping area,with a legit bank across the road for changing money. Hotel transfers were well organised to the airport. Breakfast was amazing, great selection, egg station can get chaotic which should be looked at.The staff organised a cake also for my birthday which was great. Both pools are really nice, at times can be tricky getting beds at the rooftop pool.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Debbie I;High quality but lacking a bit of local ambience;I took advantage of a Scoupon deal and felt it was great value. The Mecure is modern, clean and perfectly located for many restaurants, Legian markets and the beach. The staff were professional and as always in Bali, very friendly. My only disappointment(slight) was the generic feel to the hotel. Once reaching my floor and room, I could have been in any city in the world. Similarly in attempting to meet the broadest range of needs of international tourists, they have lost some of the charm that is pure Bali. Having visited Bali more than half a dozen times, my preference is for smaller hotels which are q ntessentially Balinese.;4;1;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Samantha H;Great Hotel Great Location;My 15 year old daughter and I recently stayed for 5 nights at the Mercure Legian Bali and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The rooms were great, food from room service was good, my only criticism would be that the Pool area upstairs was not easy to get a sun lounge or anywhere to sit and enjoy a sunbake and swim. We were up most mornings by 9am and hardly anyone around the pool area but there were hotel towels placed on day beds and lounges by people and then had gone off to do whatever they were doing so it was q te frustrating. But overall the service and rooms were great :);4;0;0;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jenny and Lloyd v;Nice hotel;The rooms were well sized and clean. Good location only 10 min walk to the beach . The staff were friendly and helpful. The option of 2 pools was great. Breakfast had a good variety of food choices and was well priced.;4;0;1;1;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jeffrey Van Eeghem;Modern hotel, friendly staff, central location & great breakfast;As Accor Platinum member I've stayed in a lot of Accor hotels, but this is one of the best Mercure hotels I've stayed at. The hospitality is amazing from the time you walk in, friendly staff (many thanks to Melisa) modern hotel with clean & comfortable rooms. The hotel isn't facing the beach, but certainly not a lack, the 2 pools do compensate it & 10min walk to the beach. At last, the hotel offers a complete, full, extensive breakfast, impossible having complaints about it! I'm definitely staying again @ Mercure Legian during one of my upcoming weekend escapes from Jakarta, hotel is +- 30min driving from the airport, which is also an advantage.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Nayrex;Great location, friendly staff & lovely infinity pools;Clean rooms with a huge balcony. A touch on the loud side if you have a room overlooking the main lobby but it's to be expected in such a busy location. The infinity pool on the 4th floor is great with poolside service and the spa located right across the hall. The food was great in the main restaurant as well.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;TaniaF;Good Central Location;The Mercure Legian is a nice 4 star hotel offering excellent service and facilities and is located within easy walking distance to the beach, shops, restaurants and bars between Kuta and Seminyak. With a good selection of rooms, the choice of 2 pools, a decent buffet breakfast, casual dining and a gym if you're so inclined, it's a great option for couples, families and friends.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Carmie_S;Fab hotel, great location;Stayed at the Mercure Legian for 4 nights in a private plunge pool room. Large room with king bed, sofa & desk.

Excellent staff and great location. Would stay again!;5;0;0;1;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Daniel M;Fantastic value!;We stayed at the Mercure Bali Legian hotel and so glad we did. The hotel offers great value for money with 2 swimming pools at different levels - one on the ground floor and the other one on level 4. The breakfasts every morning were outstanding and so enjoyable with a big variety. The atmosphere the hotel offers is calm, bright and welcoming. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The hotel is near all amenities, shops and close to the sea. You can easily reach every destination like shops and places with interest by foot or taxis are always an easy solution.;5;1;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;PerthAli;Scoopon if you can;Booked a Scoopon deal where we got breakfast, 2 dinners, 2 massages, 14 beers etc was well worth the value. We opted for a king deluxe balcony room and it was fine, spacious and well eq pped however I think they need to look at the laundry service, the towels and sheets were old and often stained even when cleaned. Staff are all very helpful and friendly. Pools - there are 2 one on the ground floor and one on the fourth floor, the prettier one is on the ground however this attracted young children and we wanted to avoid that so opted for the fourth floor, both pool areas are too small for the number of people the hotel holds and no where near enough sun beds often causing dramas however the pool guys are very good and if they can see people reserving them and disappearing after;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Lindy T;Modern Hotel in heart of Legian;I had read reviews regarding this hotel being noisy as it is located on Legian Road and when we first check in we were given a room facing the road. As it was late I called and asked if we could be moved to a q eter room the next morning and the hotel was very happy to accommodate my request. Overall the hotel is modern and clean with very helpful staff. Great location near to all restaurants, shops and beach. Has 2 pool areas, gym and spa. Great value for money;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Mariska T;Very enjoyable stay!;We stayed for 2 nights and it was a very nice experience. Despite the long queue at the check in, we were given chill j ce when we waited for the check in process to be done. The room was ready when we got there at 12:30, so we got early check in :) the bed sheets was a lil damp and has sands, but the cleaning team change it right away when we called. Breakfast was awesome! We can make our own fresh j ce :D it has a pretty good variety of food. They called us too an hour before check out to remind us for our check out time. Another thing is, eventhough the hotel is not in front of the beach, the walk is not too far. 5-10mins walk, and we can enjoy the beach. The hotel is very strategic with lots of good and inexpensive restaurants surround it. Overall it was excellent and we;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Garry A;QUALITY with a SMILE;I have stayed in Bali many times , but this is the first time at the Mercure. It's central location makes it easy to get around and only 5 minutes walk to the beach. Across the road is a good money changer and laundry, plus an Italian restaurant. Everyone from the security guard to the manager all had smiles, nothing was ever to much of a problem, check in and check out was easy and q ck. My room was next to the pool and very q et spotlessly clean and excellent bathroom. Breakfast is huge and plenty of selection.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

All of what the hotel has to offer is excellent from check in to the restaurant and the tour desk the pool and room cleaning staff. In fact all of the staff are terrific. Located in a handy position, close to shops and restaurants and money changers. Easy to catch a taxi right out the front, it's there within easy reach. It's so good there that I have booked a return visit in 2018.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

The hotel is super modern and omg the pool....AMAZING! The food from the hotel was so good we didn't want to eat out!

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Trvltrio;Excellent staff, great value for money;The room was lovely and q et (we were overlooking the pool, not the busy main road). Lots of storage space was appreciated. King size bed enough space for two adults and our pre-school son. Rooms secure. Good size bathroom. Bathroom door lock broken but no bother. Blinds in the shower a bit tatty, could do with an upgrade but again, no bother. Ground floor pool was great, lots of shade and sun options. Kids pool appreciated! We didn't eat at the restaurant as it was a bit pricey but the breakfast looked good and was certainly tempting. Best thing about the Mercure was the staff. Every single person we interacted with showed an impeccable standard of service. We will go straight back to Mercure Legian if we return.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Calum S;Nice hotel;Lovely hotel with excellent staff a facilities and a top notch location a pool on the ground floor and a nice see through one on the 4th floor - plus a poolside bar very comfy for when you get tired of the surf! The hotels a ten minute walk away from the beach and about a 20 minute walk to the nightlife in Kuta. My only gripes are that its culturally bereft but i think thats more to do with the place than the hotel. Also you're liable to hear drunk tourists [Australians] coming and going at all hours of the night. overall definitely reccomended.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;susancrawford305;Highly Recommended;We have stayed here many times. Once again we were very happy.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;StephF22;Relaxing stay;Stayed here for a week and it was really good! The first room that we got was excellent, didn't have any view but it wasn't a big deal for us. We didn't choose to have breakfast at the hotel but we saw that it had plenty of choices. Hotel is about a 7 minute walk to Legian beach and from there, about 20 minutes walk to Kuta/Seminyak. Really nice restaurants surrounding it as well. We decided to extend our stay but had to check out for a day as they had no rooms available but upon return the next day, the room we were placed in wasn't as good as the last. It looked tired and had a bad smell. The walls had foot prints on them. We asked to have our rooms changed but were told that they'll get house keeping to get rid of the smell (they managed to) but our air conditioning wasn't;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;tricia64;Here Now;We are staying here now in a plunge pool room. Hotel is nice and rooms very clean although a bit dark. Breakfast is great with a huge choice. Staff are all very nice. Always saying hello and asking how your holiday is. My only problem is the bed. It is the hardest bed I have ever slept on!! Have put another topper on the bed and am sleeping on top of the q lt trying to make it softer but to no avail. I can hardly walk I'm so sore!!!! If I hadn't already paid I would change hotels to try and get a softer bed.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Emmielou24;Good hotel and location;Room was lovely and comfortable, bathroom was beautiful. We didn't have time to use the pool so can't comment. Was a little noisy with traffic whistles. Location was good for legian beach a 7 min walk away, 15-20 min walk to Kuta. Staff were polite but not so great at directions, don't book tours through the hotel very over priced theres plenty of stools down the strip (Side note- legian and kuta are loud and very touristy, like a Asian magaluf);4;0;1;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;tarnee2015;Great service by friendly staff;We arrived late at night after a very long trip - the room we were allocated was extremely noisy (traffic) but the man on the desk was able to change us to a room that was much q eter and he did it without any fuss. Thank you. The hotel is very nice we had a lovely sized room with a great balcony. The staff are excellent, from the Security guards, gardeners, porters, reception, cleaning, pool, restaurant staff everyone was helpful and lots of smiles and chats - just great. Buffet breakfast was excellent (I need to lose a few pounds lol). The only downside for us was the road noise as we prefer a q eter location.

Enjoyed my shopping there. 2 pool areas, one on ground floor the other on 4th floor. I found the laundry service very expensive, I didn't check prices before I put it in and ended up for a $57 bill. I wish we had a balcony or a window that opened. I guess you get what you pay for. Next time I would prefer to stay closer to Seminyak. But can't really fault the hotel.;4;0;1;1;0;1;0

Large pool on ground floor and another rooftop one. Very fast wifi all around the hotel, free of charge. Only downside was our room on 1st night was at the corner of 2 very busy streets and we were kept awake by traffic noise.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Chaitanya D;AT THE CORNER;Looking for place to stay in BALI that ticks all the boxes well here it is the place on the corner . Its convenient , clean, well appointed rooms, excellent staff and of course a humongous breakfast. Mercure Legian has that cozy feel of a boutique hotel and all the amenities to go with it. A special thanks goes out to the wonderful staff who are the true ambassadors of this establishment. Guest services - what can I say these lovely ladies made sure that the overall experience was excellent a special thank you to Melisa, Fani, Bulan. Welsen at the reservation. Chef Wayan, Chef Vanda and their team displayed a delectable selection of food every morning. Putra & his staff made sure rush hour at breakfast was taken care with a deft touch. At the helm is Olivier a charming gentleman;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

We had a room on the 5th level with balcony which was handy for hanging out damp clothes to dry as they provide a clothes rack. Money changer with the best rate we could find is straight across the road from it. They only deal in cash so dont turn up with your credit card expecting to get money from them. It's better to swap your money once you are in Bali rather than doing it in NZ as the exchange rate is much better. Our room had squeeky ranch slider doors so we had to sleep with them open to stop the noise. We informed the front desk who were most apologetic and would've fixed for us if we really wanted them to.

The Executive Sous Chef Afdal Irvanda Lubis is very approachable to discuss anything food related that you wish to raise. At the other end of the scale ate the day workers. A day worker of note is Purniasih. Always has a warm welcoming smile and no request is too much. We had dealings with her at the pool bar and the main dining hall. Excellent service in both locations. A phenominal memory to or likes and dislikes, she preempted a lot of our needs.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

The hotel itself was wonderful. It has two amazing pool areas, as well as rooms with private plunge pools. The restaurants in the hotel are excellent, you have one area for light refreshments poolside, as well as a more formal restaurant as well. Also the breakfasts are amazing. The hotel rooms are lovely, and when my husbands back was hurting we asked if we could have a firmer mattress and it was done immediately. Due to bouts of Bali belly in the past, we are very cautious about where we eat. We ate exclusively in the hotel and came home without any occurrences. I can't speak highly enough about this hotel, and it will be our "" go to"" hotel in the future.";5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Bear in mind that English is not their first language. Our room was cleaned on a daily basis. Great job! However, they kept moving our belongings. Our belongings were placed along the wall where there was no need to move them as the stuff was out of the way. The A/C seemed to get warmer at about 1am ish then gets cool again after 7am ish.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Judith W;As good a place as any to crash in Bali.;This hotel is huge. It houses large numbers of westerners on holiday in Bali and is pretty much what you'd expect of a western style hotel in Bali. It is not a resort although it has two swimming pool areas. The massage I had there was excellent. My room had a shiny stone floor which could have been problematic when the air con leaked and I felt water on the floor in the hallway in the middle of the night. Fortunately I didn't fall over and the management arranged to repair the fault immediately I reported it the next morning. Restaurant breakfast & dinners not remarkable. OK.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Rooms were a decent size (are actually smaller than the pictures.) We did have bugs the first few days we were there, but there was bug spray in the room, so I don't know if that is normal or not? The only disappointing thing for us was the pools. They weren't very big and one of them had shade most of the day. They also don't have many sunbeds to lie on. By one of the pools were was only 10 and basically all in the shade. You needed to be up early to get them, otherwise you would have to go to the beach.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Got an upgrade due as Gold Le Club member, and I got the Deluxe King Bed room with balcony. Loooved the balcony a lot. Loved the fact that it was a cold rainy weekend then.

When we asked where we could smoke they stated outside the front entry. I didn't mind that you couldn't smoke in the rooms as I don't like smoking rooms however if you are going to make people smoke out the front entry then they could at least have some sort of seating for people to sit on.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Karyn R;So happy we chose The Mecure Legian;Found a great deal on The Mecure Legian so decided to give them a go and was so glad we did. Everything was perfect. We had a pool room view on the 5th floor and it was spotless and very comfortable. Air conditioning was really good and the bed and pillows I could not fault. Staff are very helpful and friendly. There are two pools and both have plenty of pool lounges and are very comfortable, I know as I layed on them for most of my holiday. For a large hotel it is very q te and has a really relaxed feel. If you like to be in the middle of everything then the location would be perfect for you being on the corner of Melasti and Legian Street. There is a minimart,laundry and money changer straight across the road that we used and I would recommend them highly. Would I stay at The;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;dao68;Still a nice Hotel;It been over a year since I have stayed at the Mecure Legian Hotel. The check in at late at night was very smooth and welcoming. The standard of Breakfast was still at a very good standard and the selection is still very good. The only small down side is that one there was not bain maire with fried and scrambled eggs and the poor chef where ran off their feet making the to order. It nice to know that the staff that have been there for awhile still recognise your face. The rooms are still lovely and clean and it nice to see that all the balconies now have chairs and a table. Thank you to staff to hotel and keep up the great standard. I will be back;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Grace K;Delightful stay;My husband is accor plus gold member, we always stay at Accor hotels. This time, we tried Mercure Legian. At the first night my husband was disturbed by the music noise coming from across the hotel. But when he complained about this to the staff, they immediately follow through and moved him to a more q et room. Promptness is absolutely 10 out of 10. Very well done. I didn't q te remember the lady's name in the Accor member desk, but she was delightful and helpful towards us. Very well done. All the other staff are also very friendly and helpful, whether you are local or international guests. Very professional indeed! My room was decent, clean and spacious enough. However, the bed was too soft for someone who has back problem like me. Hot water is immediately there, so;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Darwin_NTNTtraveller;One of best hotels in Legian;Stayed here for first time for 4 days, was great location on corner of Melasti and Legian rd. Q ck check in and to room, reception took credit card inprint during processing, had a few issues getting extra bed pillows as had to ask numerous times which took till the 2nd night before actually got them. The room was spacious with extra large balcony area outside, had issues with cleaning staff not locking sliding doors after room serviced each day which informed reception many times but didnt seem to care, not secure room then if anyone wanted to get in as balcony access very easy for anyone from 2nd floor lifts exit. King size bed was very soft and comfortable to sleep and made up each day. Hotel had tour desk which seemed to have a lot of options and information when asked for;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Brian;Good but noisy;We were on 2nd floor but it was really too noisy even late at night or early morning. Too much honking and traffic noise. Swimming pool is too small to my liking and believe it or not, such a big hotel but only one iron and one ironing board to go around. Had to wait over a day to get one so I could iron my s t for the wedding that I was going to attend with my wife. We were upgraded to executive, not too bad except we r directly facing the traffic.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;TreadingTheGlobe;Amazing location in the middle of the action;The Mercure Bali Legian is the perfect location in the Kuta and Legian area. You can walk to the beach, the clubs and the shops. However the hotel is like a tropical oasis where you can retreat and relax in the pools or enjoy excellent spa treatments. Pool view rooms with private balconies are a great choice as are the plunge pool rooms with pools set in a small courtyard. As with all hotels the staff make or break it and here the staff are amazing. The service and attention to details are spot on. The beds are super comfy...;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;arunamarnath;Located near all the Tourist Destinations;Mercure Bali Legian is located centrally among the Tourist places. The Rooms were average sized but maintained well and hygnic. The rooms have a balcony to enjoy your morning Tea. There is free wifi. The Breakfast is continental with a good spread and with a lot seating. There are 2 pools with one on the roof. The kids had a great time at the pool. Had an issue with the attitude of the staff regarding food served to the children at the swimming pool. The Children were made to wait till the payment was settled in spite of the request to charge it to the rooms. They were let off only when of the adult members found them. Even though the staff apologised later, the attitude of the Staff in a Tourist Friendly Place like Bali, leaves a VERY BAD TASTE.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Melanie M;Loved our stay at the Mercure;I can't say enough positives about our recent stay at the Mercure. My husband and I had a deluxe room with balcony and worth the bit extra. The cleanliness of the complex is outstanding and great amenities. The food is excellent too and reasonably priced. It is an ideal position to access the Legian markets, short walk to the beach and easy access to either Kuta or Seminyak on Legian road. Above all, the staff are lovely - professional and attentive and made our stay so enjoyable. We will definitely be back.;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;I Nijland;Value for money but not too long to stay !!!;+Our second times to stay in Mercure hotel Legian. We like the hotel with both swimming pools especially on the roof top. A lot of choices for breakfast for westerns and locals. Friendly employees who greetz you everytime ( Dhanny from the swimming pool master en yoga teacher ), Ella and Ratna from the waitress. All of the employees of the hotel are friendly. Only 10 minutes walk to the beach. Many shops arround. Short drive with the taxi to all entertainment area. ATM is in the corner of the hotel easy to take money. There is no noise anymore from the housekeeping trolley in the corridor. -The noise from the busy streets ( we got a room close to the busy street ) We heard screaming drunk customers or someone move the chair or any activities from other rooms in the evening;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Chris A;Villa well worth it;We booked flights and hotel package via Expedia (saved $$) and splurged on a villa room with a private plunge pool. We forgo-ed bundling hotel breakfast in with the stay as it was pretty pricey and simply ate at local cafes for at least half the price. Loved the rooftop pool and bar. Still close enough to be able to walk to Legian beach and nightlife around Kuta if that floats your boat. Paid just under 2.5k for return jetstar flights from Syd and 8 nights (two people);5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Greggie1;Very nice - great location.;"7 night stay here - pretty impressed with the feel of the hotel and the staff were really helpful; we had a deluxe balcony room on the second level away from most of the traffic noise and were grateful that the central water feature in the hotel grounds was turned off each night. Breakfasts were pretty good for the price we paid - certainly plenty of options although the coffee machine seemed to be ""out of order"" a few mornings - the pre-brewed coffee available was OK though; great location as is central enough to enable a walk to Kuta and an easy walk to Legian Beach - heaps of taxis available on Jalan Melasti too; whoever drove us back to the Airport on May 17th was the most careful driver I have experienced in Bali - a special mention to him ( he was given a good tip for his";4;0;1;0;0;0;0

If you are a light sleeper this room will not s t you. The hotel room is clean & comfortable but not much hanging or cupboard space for clothing. Good Money changer, shop & laundry across the street.

Returned again for another stay late April/May. Our visit to the Mercure this trip was great and the teething problems experienced last year gone. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and actually asked of ways they could improve their service etc. The hotel is in a very good location and has two fantastic pools to choose from.

The staff were lovely and incredibly helpful, and the rooms and the facilities were excellent. The best thing, however, was the location - we were in the heart of Legian and everything we needed or wanted was a short walk or taxi ride away. I would definitely recommend the Mercure Bali Legian!;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;jarrah111;Great location and value for money;This was my fourth stay at the Mercure Legian. The rooms are very clean and comfortable, great value for money. I love the location as it is conveniently positioned right next to the BMC (money changer) , across the road from Commonwealth ATM and a short walk to our favourite spa (Puurfect) and some great places to eat including the coffee corner across the road. The other thing I like is that it is easy to hail a cab from the intersection. The rooms are clean and well serviced. There is two q te large pool areas as well as a small gym. I had previously eaten room service here and not really enjoyed it, but it looks like there is a new menu but I didn't get chance to try it out this trip.;5;1;0;0;0;1;0

Had a pleasant stay & the location is handy for us as it's near to everything & we walk everywhere. Both pools are good but would be nice to receive 2 towels (only one per person allowed). Breakfast is good, more worth it if you are an Accor member as you get 2 for 1. Was surprised with a birthday cake which was nice. A bit disappointed with Check out as there was no queue system in place & about 6 people who came after us were served before us & we were waiting a while, very frustrating.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

There isn't that much space but it is well set up so it's not a problem. The ground floor pool is a bit bigger, with a kiddie pool and right by the restaurant for a handy snack!

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Upendra Swami;Getting pulse of Bali's buzz!;Well, this hotel is located in the area, where heart of Bali beats. When we were in Nusa Dua area, we were in a sort of exclusive zone with all sort of luxury and privacy. But this hotel lies in an area, where as soon as you step out of the hotel, you find yourself in the hustle & bustle of a busy tourist destination like Bali. Hotel is just a five minutes walk from the beach. Hotel is close to Legian, Seminyak and Kuta areas. The way to beach passes through the busiest tourist market of the Kuta area, with everything tourists are looking for- from food to massage to souvenirs and money changers! You feel like close to everything. So staying here is like enjoying everything day out and night and then relaxing in comfortable environs of your room. Hence this hotel might not be so;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;mycharlieboy;Great location;Second time we have stayed here. 1st time in a plunge pool room and this time in balcony room. The balcony room is a decent size. Staff are welcoming and friendly. Can't beat the location. BMC money changer across the road as is commonwealth bank and a nice coffee shop, coffee corner. Central to lots of good spas and cafes etc and the beach. They have happy hour cocktails at the rooftop pool bar from 4-7pm. I think they are around $12 AUD. I wish they would supply robes. Can't remember if they did last time or not but definitely not this time. The WIFI is free however I found it to be very slow.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

But the staff were helpful and one staff named Kris was so friendly every time we meet at the lobby he always cheers up. Good wifi connection around the hotel.

Super apologetic, happy to help. After that, great stay: I don't like rooms with no balcony or opening window, which these rooms don't have, but good location, friendly staff.

We arrived late to a standard room which was what I booked ( was a scoopon deal ), the next morning I spoke to reception about upgrading, I ended up upgrading as a surprise for my wife to a plunge pool room, what a good decision that was, nothing better than coming back to your room after a day out and about in Bali and falling into your own private pool. Breakfast is always awesome with a huge selection, we had dinner in the restaurant one night, it was q et but the atmosphere was really good for a couple and the food was really good.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;envy_eve;Love this place;We stayed at the Mercure hotel last May and fell in love with the place so we booked again for this year. So close to everything with commonwealth bank and coffee corner (best breakfast and coffee in Bali) right across the road and so close to garlic lane. This time we upgraded to a pool room and it was wonderful! So nice just to have your own privacy and they gave us one of the better pool rooms. We had a minor issue with the colour of the pool on our third last day and mentioned it to them and they fixed it straight away. They also gave us late check out and free drinks for the inconvenience. Nothing is too much for the staff, they literally go beyond and above for you and are just so friendly and accomodating. They even came into our room each night while we were out for tea;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;globetraveller94;Get what you pay for;We tried out the Mercure as last time we were in Bali it was being b lt. Q te a nice little place on the corner opposite the bank which is very convenient. Rooms average size and nice. Shower door swings inwards which is a little tricky to get in and out of. I did cut my toe open trying to open the door whilst leaning up against the shower wall to get out. No balcony on the standard room which was a shame. Breakfast was average. Would not eat there for any other occasion. We were there on their Silent Day which meant we weren't allowed to leave the hotel. They had few limited activities (fr t carving and aqua aerobics) and a movie channel. If you are forcing guests to stay in the hotel you think they would have more going on. We were up on the rooftop pool and were asked by;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Not only were the Balinese people so generous and lovely, the staff at the Mercure Bali Legian were impeccable! Nothing was too much for them. Beautifully groomed and very well mannered. Always there, willing to help. A credit to the Mercure/Accor Group. The rooms - superb! So very comfortable and the air conditioning, very welcoming! The buffet breakfast - such an array of choice, from cereals, to fr t, to toast, bacon & eggs and an omelette upon request. Both pools, clean and inviting. The massage - lovely & relaxing! It's central location was great and we had front row seats for the parade for Nyepi - another experience we will never forget!

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;carling2015;Great place to stay in Legian;Had five nights at the Mercure Legian and wished we had more. We had a balcony room overlooking one of the pools. The staff are all lovely and very obliging. Food is great, good variety and reasonably priced. Depending on where the room is located traffic noise could be a problem luckily ours (513)was not too close to the road and once the balcony door and curtains were closed traffic noise was not a problem. Location of the hotel is good in that its about 500 metres to the beach, shops and restaurants are right outside the door basically. Room and bathroom size good.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;James M;Great Hotel;We recently stayed at the Mecure Legian for a week in March 2017. We found the resort very comfortable and enjoyable. The resort has been recently renovated and is very much representative of the Accor group from which it is a member of. We have stayed at Accor hotels before and found this to be exactly what you would expect - clean, comfortable, good value for money and very friendly service. Breakfast was reasonable with good variety in a comfortable restaurant. The upstairs pool and bar were comfortable with attentive bar staff. Our room was clean, comfortable and modern in design. We would recommend this resort to our friends.;5;1;0;1;0;1;0

The food in both the restaurant and the upstairs Poole Bar was delicious. This hotel is located in probably the best spot as it is easy walking distance to all the shopping, Kuta one way and Seminyak the other. And if you give up on walking it's easy for the taxi to drop you off at the door, no one way streets. The service desk and tourist desk are great and extremely helpful with plenty of local knowledge.

It wasn't overly big, but enough to relax and have some q et time. The staff were very helpful, especially when our airconditioning leaked during the night, and we had to move rooms at 4.30am. Due to the inconvience they extended our check out time so it was closer to our flight time. They also organised a free transport to the airport.

Check-in was smooth and at 5.30am, I tried dialling room service, as breakfast advertised being served to room between 5-11am. No answer and pretty annoying considering the perceived calibre of this hotel chain. Granted I was exhausted and simply wanted a q ck snack. I went down to reception and was directed to the restaurant, to what appeared to be two members of staff setting up for breakfast.

I have reviewed it many times and this is the first time l have given it a 5 star rating as it has taken 2 years for the Owner to address many teething problems. I'm happy to see most have finally been addressed, however I hope he continues to financially support his management team to rectify the few outstanding items to put this property right up there with the very best in Legian. I'm surprised by some of the Trip Advisor comments, such as holding a security deposit. If you are a frequent traveller like me this is a very common practice amongst all Hotel's as unfortunately some Guests are not always honest. As to items like Pool Towel;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Breakfast was everything you expect from a buffet breakfast, and I also had an evening meal at the restaurant - it was a smallish serve, but the price was low - so no complaints there. I had time for a massage at their spa, and it was FABULOUS and very reasonably priced for a hotel massage (Rupiah 440K, for a 90 minute 4 hand Massage ie 2 masseuses) My only other comment is that the hotel and the room seemed a little dark, ie the lighting wasn't overly bright....My room was on the group floor and there was some shrubs/plants in front of the window, so that might have;4;1;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;13_AM_Lobb;Probably ideally s ted for those wanting to eat at the hotel and lounge by the pool;Stayed here as we needed to fill in a few days between Seminyak and Ubud so thought we'd stay in Legian as we hadn't stayed in this location for 7 years. However after coming from Seminyak with great restaurants and shops within a stones throw Legian has been a bit of a disappointment. The hotel itself is q te nice, rooms well appointed however no DVD in the room and one of the movie channels wasn't working the whole time we were here. There are 2 pool areas however the one on Level 1 seems to be more of a family/kiddy pool, so on first glance it seems to be a very small pool for the number of rooms but strangely was never overcrowded. Pool towels on the other hand were a rare commodity, so I recommend securing one before you get in the pool otherwise you could be waiting;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;heyjannn;Friendly atmosphere, attentive staff;We stayed at the Mercure over the Christmas break, and it is a very decent Accor property. You could tell this property was a little dated from the hotel facilities, but still a very decent stay, and we had no complaints. It's about 5 minutes away from Legian beach, and in the heart of the Kuta and Seminyak district. We paid about AUD25 for the airport transfer. The hotel has a very resort feel to it, and we liked it. We booked a deluxe room with our own private plunge pool, and the pool was great. It was very private, because the walls were b lt high, but anyone staying in the rooms above can stare down at you. One thing in particular I would like to comment was how friendly the staff were. They looked like they gen nely liked their job, and they went the extra mile to;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

All staff excel at their jobs & are very informative if asked a question. 2 lovely pools, one on ground floor the other on 4th floor. Guest Relations person, Melisa was brilliant.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;patvic;Great spot, great service.;We were only here 1 day / night and have stayed before at this hotel. No complaints at all, the staff were very accommodating, doing the best to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We were very impressed by the lunch / snack menu at the 4th floor pool bar and really enjoyed the tapas we selected. We had dinner in the restaurant that night and again were not disappointed by the quality of the food presented. Breakfast was buffet style and more than enough choice, and what we chose was very satisfying.

The buffet breakfast was great with a huge selection. Our room was on the 2nd floor, it was comfortable & clean, with plenty of storage space in the wardrobe & various draws. We didn't need our power adaptor as the room had two power points for Australian power plugs. Both pools were great, never had an issue getting a sun bed. Wifi was brilliant. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Joe M;Great hotel but restaurant is dodgy;We are just finishing a great stay in a plunge pool room. Air conditioning is wonderful and so too is the firm bed. Pillows are like marshmallow and not great for sleeping. The pool is awesome to relax and cool off in. Unfortunately the restaurant is not so good. Hot, stuffy and very q et. That probably explains why both me and my partner ended up becoming sick. The Ankak Burger had bacon which was like a slice of kebab meat. When asked what was wrong with our food (I didn't eat it all but my partner did) we were told that it was 'beef bacon'??? I feel that the food is reheated and left to cool befor e being brought to the table. I won't eat here again but happy to stay again. Last year I suggested putting fixed fans on the walls to cool the place. It is so hot in the foyer and;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;pduplessis;POOR START BUT ALL GOOD IN THE END;"Being a platinum Accor member I had a disappointing start. I expected a room upgrade based on the rooms selling on the Accor Website. Apparently not, instead we were given an upgrade (in someone's opinion) to a ""Junior S te"". It was on the corner of the hotel overlooking a busy/noisy road (room not that nice). Following complaint, and lots of discussions, we were offered an executive s te facing and listening to, you guessed it, the road. We elected to stay in a non-upgrade room. The following day, common sense prevailed and we were finally offered the expected upgrade and following this I could not be more complimentary of our stay. Wonderful friendliness, service and facilities. While it took one night, thanks to all that made everything come it good in the end.";5;0;0;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;SarahTomsic;Lovely Trip;Myself and my boyfriend stayed at the Mercure, Legian for 11 nights at the start of December. We had a basic room, no balcony on the 5th floor. It was kept very clean, room staff came in at least twice a day as long as we didn't have the do not disturb sign up. The king mattress was very comfortable, only 1 pillow each was provided however we could have asked for more pillows from reception according to the information pack. Our original flights were cancelled and could not get to Bali until the following day, I emailed the Mercure and they happily moved our reservation over a day for us without issues. We did not include breakfast in our booking as we felt $15pp per day was a bit much for Bali prices, especially with the amount of cafes in the area that could feed two people;4;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;jarrah111;Very good hotel in a convenient location;I really liked the Mercure in Legian, the service, cleanliness and overall appearance were great.

I had room service twice which wasn't great and obviously more expensive than standard Bali prices, but there are plenty of nice places to eat nearby.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0

The location was good on Legian street next to many small shops. The wifi was fast (measured at 10 Mbps). The water pressure was good but the hot water temperature was unstable. The service overall was good until an incident on the day before we checked out (Dec 11th). The housekeeper took 2 of our dirty towels and did not replace it. So around 2 pm I called the operator to ask for the towels to be replaced. After 15 minutes I called again to ask for a technician to fix my tv and asked about the towels again. Within 5 minutes the techician came and fixed the tv but still no news on the towels. Around 2:30 pm I called again to ask about the towels. Finally around;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

This hotel is central to everything and they allow uber pick ups and drop offs so no dramas at all with transport. Staff are extremely friendly and attentive. We used both pools multiple times a day. It's unfortunate that not many of the guests do though. We decided to opt in for the breakfast on one of the mornings. It was on the average side unfortunately but it forced us to explore the immediate surroundings. Coffee corner across the street was our daily breakfast place. Overall loved our stay and will definitely be back and will chose the mercure brand again for sure!;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

The first night we had to stay in a room with the balcony facing onto Jalan Legian, very noisy, but this was due to the late arrival. The next morning I spoke to the desk manager, Oggy, he understood and within ten minutes we were given keys to check two rooms. They were both overlooking the 4th floor pool, we chose room 567 (yeah easy to remember) this room over looked the pool and a portion of the bar, there was music heard from the bar, but it was low and stopped by 10.30pm.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;MrPenyiar .;20min walk from Kuta Beach, endless restaurants & shops;I've stayed at several Mercures and I've been to Bali many times so I was apprehensive about this one. The Accor group tends to overdo its establishments and this one is some proof of it. The breakfast resto is just next to the sidewalk so you get the full treatment of pollution, noise and pedestrians. They have a dedicated table and staff for your (added-cost) visits to Bali's places of interest, but they have a shortage of staff manning the receptionist desk. I got the top floor at a corner room complete with corner balcony, which I suppose for smokers is q te a treat, but the view was standard Legian minus the beach. The rooms are nice and the typical Accor Group beds & pillows are there to make your sleep a great one. However I found the volume of the shower water very low;4;0;0;0;0;0;1

The beach is in walking distance (10-20 minutes) The airport can be reached in 20-40 minutes upon traffic. The hotel surrounding offers a lot of activities, massage salons, day spas, restaurants and supermarkets are very close.

We could not fault the cleanliness or maintenance of the rooms, corridors or lobbies.

Hotel room was very clean and tiny and no musky smell as a lot of Bali hotels do. Upstairs pool was a big hit for us lots of sun and bar stuff went above and beyond. The fitness center was also great everything you need for decent workouts during ur time away.. only real downside I could pick if I had too was some prices.. Cocktails were a little pricey for Bali maybe a bitter happy hour deal could combat this like half price happy hour or buy one get one free. Other than that was a great stay I do recommend and we will surly be back.. Thankyou Mercure;4;0;0;1;0;1;0

We stayed in the Plunge Pool room which is beautiful, the pool was greatly used throughout our stay with the humidity we felt, was great to go for a dip after a day out. The housekeeping team do a great job & some will do the towel art which is always fun. Our only reservation would be that the air-con didn't always keep up, but was still a lot cooler than outside.

The hotel lobby area is open air and provides an up-scale welcome with full porter service to transport luggage directly to your room. As a Le Club Accor Member with top-tier status I enjoyed complimentary tea on arrival and a drink at the bar (of the non-alcoholic variety which was disappointing for loyal guests).

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;520Sharon;Great Location;This is our fourth trip to Bali, our first time staying at a different hotel and using a scoopon deal, for a seven night stay which turned out excellent value for money. The hotel is centrally located, and on a busy intersection so if you are a light sleeper go for a room at the back. Our room was above the fountain in the reception, which had a huge balcony, but no outdoor furniture. We spoke to reception and by the time we come back from our walk furniture had been delivered. The room was clean, bed was comfortable & bathroom clean. Could not fault the friendliness of staff and willingness to help. We tried both the pools and each time we were able to get a sun lounger, however l expect during peak season you would struggle to get one. Being centrally located you could walk;4;1;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Peter A;Very Modern Hotel;This hotel took a long time to b ld passing it many times on our trips to Bali. The night we were due to fly out the plane was delayed and the airline put us up in this hotel. Have never stayed in a 5 star before. Very clean,new and great views from the balcony. Unfortunately the bars closed before we had a chance to have a drink. Beds were comfortable but the noise from the road was very loud. Being on a corner and motorbikes with faulty muffles all hours of the night. I had ear plugs as well. I hardly slept. Breakfast was fantastic. If the hotel could do something about the noise would stay here again because in a good central position. But as is never again;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;TheClarkeClan;Great Location;This is one of the newest hotels in Legian, and is still looking in good condition. The entrance and foyer are well presented and have a nice atmosphere. The check in was pleasant and efficient and all staff throughout the hotel were all very friendly across our 8 day stay. The room was nice and modern, and was reasonably clean. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were all very soft. I imagine we could have asked for different pillows, but kept forgetting, and just put up with it. The bathroom was well appointed, with a large shower. The hotel has two pools, both of them are not huge in size though. They do however have a nice feel.... especially the pool on the 4th floor near the bar, it has a lot of sunbeds and very comfortable lounges to relax in. The prices of the;4;0;0;1;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;beccymurchie;Best hotel I've ever stayed at!!!!!!!;I stayed at the Mercure Legian for five days with my father in two seperate rooms. The rooms were very good and comfortable and the staff were incredible. I would particularly like to point out one staff member out his name was Budiada he worked in the restaurant he took his own personal time to help me to learn how to speak Indonesian language. His customer service was outstanding. Budiada is an asset to your hotel and he takes pride in his job everyday. You should be proud of your staff at the Mercure Legian it is very apparent that the staff are taken care of as they are happy and are wanting to please. And thanks to Budiada's outstanding customer service I will be returning to the Mercure Legian Bali for a holiday again. The wifi in the hotel was very good and fast and I;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Bruno035;Some improvements still needed.;I have reviewed this property many times and I find it conflicting to criticise it as the Staff are as good as it gets in Bali and I do not wish to offend them. Also the location is second to none with a good choice of room types. My complaints are still levelled clearly at the Owner and his Jakarta based team. Issues like balcony furniture , improving the danger of slippery tiles around the pool and tightening of the Smoking regulations are appreciated. However to make this a truly great Hotel they have still not addressed the issue of adequate ventilation in eating and reception areas. It can be very uncomfortable and sometimes intolerable depending on the weather conditions. Lack of disabled access to the Restaurant is still unresolved. I truly feel sorry for the Management;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Kenny;Great Private Pool Room;I Stayed here on two occasions over two weeks. 2 nights the first stay and 3 nights the second. On both occasions I stayed in the Plunge pool room with different rooms over the two stays. The rooms were clean and everything was modern and in good condition. The aircon was lovely and cold and the blackout curtins work good. The bed in both rooms and the pillows were great. The best sleeps I had on our trip. The whole hotel was clean and in good condition with everything pictured on TripAdvisor. The location is fantastic with great access to Legian and Kuta and lots of taxis going past so transportation is easy. My only gripe would have to be the breakfast. At 150 000 Rp each which I thought was high and the food was cold on the hot buffet and the selection was not huge. My wife;5;0;1;0;1;1;1

I requested a specific room number via email before arrival and was very pleased this request was met. We had a plunge pool room and it was just perfect. We did not have breakfast included and did pay to eat there once, but if you had to pay I would not recommend as it cost $33 for the two of us. If you walk up to seminyak just past double six there is a cafe called grain (about 20 minute walk) and this was spectacular. we walked there early in the shade all the way. We did have lunch at the cafe at the Mecure and found it very good. We also had drinks at night up at the rooftop pool (It was to hot during the day) and found it to be a nice ambience.

One of staff called Fani, which helped us to get to room on the first day was really delightful and helpful while we are staying in Mercure for 4-5days.

If I was to stay again I would book a room with a balcony so I could let fresh air in. The location was great for shopping and restaurants and the money exchange across the road felt secure. We spent a lot of the time in the upstairs pool it was very relaxing as the pool downstairs seemed to have been more for the kids. Overall I would definitely stay there again.;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

Was disappointed when the check in did not go as smoothly as it should and when we got into the room did not seem to be ready very sparse on bathroom toiletries etc. Voiced my concerns to the manager as we were going to be there for 11 nights. He could not be more accommodating even moved us to another room and from then on could not have asked for better the staff were wonderful and also the hotel is so central not far to walk to anything. I would recommend to all. The breakfast was more than anyone could want and the staff were happy if you wanted anything that was not there to get it.

I'll start with the room, I got the Executive S te. Lovely, very spacious, it has 2 balconies, 1 with a rattan swing chair. Larga bathroom, loved the 2 sinks. The only complaint I have, is the lighting, the room is very dim light, maybe it's purposely designed but I'm the type of person who can't stand dark/dim lit rooms. The facilities: meeting room, 2 pools, kids play room & gym. The meeting room was a bit tight, with low ceilings and dim lighting, it feels smaller than it actually is. Need to add printer facility to the business centre. The kids play room is better than most places I've seen, they actually have toys and books, more s table for toddlers. The kids pool is okay, I only wish;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Ronzo50;nice;With only a short say in Bali ( 5 nights ) we chose to stay at the Mercure because it was relatively new and very central to a lot of our favourite restaurants. We choose a ground floor room with a private plunge pool . The hotel is bright and modern .and the reception staff friendly and helpful . The room is sort of small to Bali standards but not cramped by any means . Comfortable and modern. The pool area is nice but small as is the breakfast restaurant. This was a great place to stay for a few days but any longer and I prefer the resort style pool and the all you eat breakfast buffet with bacon.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

Bar fridge was small and struggled to keep water cold and didn't have a freezer. The room was tidy, but could do with a better clean. We had left over whiskers in the sink (yuk) and some pretty cakes on soap scum on the vanity. The balcony was huge and a little safer than some in Bali! Only one chair on the balconh. We had a pool view balcony. The pools are busy and need more beds/chairs. Room service was average, overpriced and basic food. Breakfast was nice,;4;0;0;0;1;0;1

The pools were a great relaxing point of our day.( expected to be heated water but really glad it wasn't … bali is hot enough without heated pools ) I couldn't find much time for the massages ..only had one at the end of our stay.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;cathpiccolo;I would recommend this hotel to family and friends;Stayed in room 568 and was extremely satisfied with the services we received. Staff were helpful, oblI stayed at the hotel in room 568 and was extremely satisfied with the service my husband and I received. The room was cleaned thoroughly each day and tea, coffee and water were replenished on a daily basis. The staff were very helpful and obliging and most of all very friendly and approachable. The breakfast buffet was superb with a variety of foods to choose from. The only thing which lets the hotel down slightly which has nothing to do with the staff is the traffic noise from the busy street Cathy Piccolo;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Kendell E;Great Location;Really good location. Staff were all extremely attentive and always had a smile on their face and would go out of their way to help you. Great to see such enthusiasm. The rooms were immaculate. Only issue was the balcony only had 1 chair on it. We did eventually get a second chair. This did seem to be the way it was on most balconies. Not really sure why this would be?;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;mfgf1967;The most helpful staff that we have ever come across.;My wife got seriously ill with diabetis one week into our Bali holiday. We had to call an ambulance to the hotel as she was unconscious. From that point on the staff were absolutly fantastic, never have I experienced such compassion and care. The team gen nely were concerned for the well being of my wife during her stay in hospital and ensured that all was looked after for myself during my extended stay at the hotel. I never needed for anything they made sure I had food and travel to and from the hospital throughout my stay. I was on my own and the team asked everyday how I was and listened to the day that I had experienced and the concerns I felt during my wives stay in hospital. We were informed that our insurance did not cover us for what had occurred and the hotel ensured;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Tracy P;Not as good as first visit but still good.;This is my second visit. Although it is still a great location, it wasnt as good service. I emailed twice and send message on facebook and had no reply to our early arrival so had to pay for transfers that were included, twice management were going to contact me but didnt. My friends room wasnt ready until after 6.30pm which was terrible as they allowed late check out for someone else so my friends had to wait. They didnt change my sheets once in the week visit although I put card on floor so they would (only expected once or twice during visit). STILL no furniture on balcony so no idea what point of balcony is. Bath robes have had sash removed so cant wrap around, also pointless. Fridges in room hardly cold at all. Gym too small for size of hotel. The good now, rooms;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Gail31_11;Good hotel;Good hotel, room lovely, great staff and great value for money. Location good- a short walk to Kuta close to a number of good eateries in Legian. Downstairs pool a little q et, but enjoyed the upstairs pool. Only negative is the tv reception- not a lot to chose from if you want to relax in your room and the reception keeps freezing. No dvd either. I recommend you update that as it is q te frustrating. It's not only limited to the rooms it was happening in the bar too.;4;1;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Shelvy;A good hotel in Seminyak;Everything is ok. A good standard hotel with a good value of money. If you want to explore Bali and need a good hotel to rest at night, you'll might consider this hotel. Location is a bit off, but u can rent a motorbike and go exploring the city. Checking in was a bit slow, considering it was during a peak holiday in Indonesia.;4;1;0;0;0;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Msintorquay;1 week in Bali;Nice motel, close to Kuta, Saminyak and onlt a 384 rupiah taxi ride to the Gallaria shopping centre. The tourist market is out the dront door annd the beach is a 10 minute walk. Motel is 2 years old, looking a little tired, but the amenities are superb. It gas 2 pools, massage area, kids room. Good for familes. Pool area - lovely looking area, the only issue is you have to be down at the pool by 7am to reserve a day bed by the pool. Thiscarea should be better managed and supervised. Breakfast - be sure to add breakfast to your room charge when booking, as you will not be dissappointed. Enjoyed the week there, it was very relaxing.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jo W;Location, location, location;Great resort, restaurant and features. Check-in procedure is hap-hazard and not up to Accor standard for Accor + members. Room not ready despite having airport pick up (arrival at 3pm) and felt like we were just given any room in the end. Room provided was not what we had booked (Deluxe King Bed with Balcony) and this was not explained to us. When I asked at reception it was explained that we were given bigger room with no balcony but I don't see how this is possible as there is no such room on the website. We have stayed here on a previous occasion and have had the same check-in experience each time. Hotel is close to restaurants, bars, shopping and banks in Legian. Staff are helpful and restaurant is great. We had afternoon snack and breakfast there. It is a great resort;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Krissy P;Very impressed, good quality.;Stayed here with my Mum from 6-10 August for the first leg of our visit to Bali. I must say I was very impressed with everything for the duration of my stay. Rooms are a good size and very clean. There are 2 pools - one on level 4 (with a pool bar - more for adults) and one on ground level (more child-friendly). We used the pool on level 4 more often as there were more sun lounges available and a really cool shallow pool with four submerged sun lounges that you can lie on in the pool and relax! The breakfast buffet was amazing, one of the best selections I've ever seen, so much variety and it changed a little bit every day. Really nice ambience in the restaurant as well as it looks out onto the pool and if you're inside, there is aircon so its nice and comfortable. We tried;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;KatePe;2nd time here - still a great choice for location and value;We stayed here again (we were here in 2015) after a Webjet deal came up that proved too good to not take up. After reflecting upon our last stay, we decided it was a great hotel in a perfect location, so we booked again, this time with some friends. Again, we found the Mercure to be a well presented hotel and great value for money. We were not unhappy that we chose to stay here again. Last year we noted that service by the the pool needed attention, and were disappointed that this still was the case. More attention to people around the pool and checking whether they req re food or drinks will only generate more money for the hotel. After last year we knew the 'Kid's Club' was just really a room with toys and was unmanned, however i did email prior to coming to be told it was;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Mickg54;Good quality, good location;Recently stayed here with a group of friends from Australia, although we had requested rooms close to our friends, initially we were on a different floor, however hotel moved us next to them the next day. The hotel is modern, rooms decent size and clean. Pools on ground and fourth floor, decently eq pped gym, and a very good restaurant. They have a nurse on site, who was very helpful when one of our guests had a problem. The hotel is in a good location for shops and bars/restaurants, and the beach is about a 10 min walk away. Would recommend this hotel.;4;0;1;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jacowen82;Great location!;We recently stayed 8 nights with 4 adults and two young children. The location was great. Easy walk to the beach and lots of affordable dining and shopping options within close range! The breakfast range was ok and the food and drinks were reasonably priced for a resort. The pools were good but small (downstairs pool was good for young children) but the kids club was just a small room with a few toys (definitely should not be advertised as a kids club!) The staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating and overall, we enjoyed our stay!;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Camilla H;Average but good for short stay;This hotel was nice to stay in for the three nights we had in Bali, however there were a few issues. They did not give us the room we booked, which was a double, instead we were given two singles pushed together which they tried to make look like a double. This was annoying as we had chosen a certain type of room and the hotel should accommodate this. The room was also VERY noisy because it was next to the road, which made the fact we hadn't been given the sort of room we booked even worse. The rest of the hotel is nice although we didn't eat or go to the bar at the hotel so cannot comment on this. Centrally located near the beach and markets all along the roads with tourist stuff to buy.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Room itself (351) was wonderful & spacious. Must admit to re-arranging layout of room to s t our needs (returning it to its original layout before departure). Lack of luggage storage was inconvenient for such a large space. Bathroom was extremely spacious & well appointed, although we did experience drainage issues in the shower cabin. Our room on the noisy side of the hotel (Jalan Legian) made sleep sometimes difficult due to lack of double glazing. Jalan Legian traffic is relentless all day & night, especially revved up motor bikes. Sitting on the balcony was accompanied by a constant cacophony of sounds.

You can choose wether you want your sheets changed each day to be more eco friendly, which I think is a great idea. Awesome roof top pool with AMAZING cocktails at the bar.

Unfortunately, no chair, no table, nothing in balcony. While I saw other room with balcony have it. Different price? IDK. Since I don't use balcony, I don't really care. Bathroom with glass wall in other side look nice and modern, but somebody can sneak out, haha. IDR 75000 for rent a scooter. Cheap price to explore the city. I like the pool on 4th floor.

Room was immaculate, really big shower, huge balcony with a day bed on it, WIFI is really fast, breakfast was the best I've ever had, lovely staff. Great location. The only issues we had was the hotel was q te busy, so we had trouble getting a sun lounger by the pool in the morning. Also, FYI: the hotel holds a deposit of 200 Rupiah per day which is a little inconvenient as you get your money back when you check out but then you are left with rupiah to go home with. I'm not sure if they would allow USD or AUD (we didn't ask as we were happy to take rupiah home for our next trip). However, If you order room service, drinks, or anything from the hotel, this amount can be deducted from your total owing on departure. Would;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

But it will be returned. Make sure you have a credit card with you! The hotel is so beautiful and looks even better than the photos say. The rooms and pools are clean. The buffet in the morning is very nice. In the evening you'll à la carte and it is so delicious. On the 4th floor it has a pool with a poolbar which offers nice snacks/tapas. From the hotel to the beach you have to walk 7-8 minutes. Pay attention on the street it could be very dangerous! The beach is nice, very;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Marcus R;Bali Trip;We usually stay in Kuta but this time we decided to stay somewhere else and the Mercure sounded the best of them all. Can't complain about the room it was nice and clean. We only ate breakfast at the Hotel and there was plenty of choice and one day when i was not very well the staff even brought some breakfast up for me which has really good of them. The pool on the ground floor was the better one although it was really nice to sit up the top (pool) area and feel the nice breeze which came across the area. The only downside was the beers were more expensive in that part. Really nice hotel and if you could move it down to Kuta (the places we always visit when we are in Bali) it would have been perfect. Staff were very good although it took a while to book out, if you like;4;0;0;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;kjpee90;Excellent stay;Comfortable, clean, convenient location to the lovely Kuta beach (5 mins walk). Staff very friendly, were extremely helpful I cannot thank them enough! I lost my GoPro camera and purse so they took me to the police station to report, when I was returning they found my purse and looked up ways to get it back to me and corresponded through email. It was too expensive so I told them to destroy it which they confirmed when they had. Pool area is q te small, so this hotel is not ideal for all day lounging by the pool unless you get up early to get a bed. If you want to spend your mornings and afternoon travelling around, then come back to the pool late afternoon to catch the last of the Rays on the roof with some good music then this is the hotel for you;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;leenjeff;Great location and great service;Our recent holiday to Bali was fantastic. The Bali Mecure Legian had excellent service and in was in a perfect location. All their staff were professional and couldn't do enough for you. We asked to change rooms to be closer to our friends and we were accommodated. The breakfast was very nice good variety just needed waffles. The restaurant and pool service was brilliant a special mention to Agus Pradnyana who was very friendly and spoke amazing English, he went out of his way to provide us with a high standard of service. Thank you again. We would not hesitate to return to your hotel.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Monique W;Nice hotel;Excellent Scoopon deal with the newish hotel in busy Legian. Nice pools, reasonable rooms and breakfasts. Just a couple of issues - one dodgy powerpoint which kept on tripping and our room flooded during a rainstorm apparently due to the incorrectly b lt slope on our balcony. We also ordered breakfast boxes on two mornings, but on both mornings they were not ready. Was well compensated however with two free massages on our last day.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;catherine w;Thankyou Mecure Bali Legian for another wonderful holiday;Well what can I say after holiday number five in this fabulous hotel that I haven't already said .I wont go on about the rooms or the two wonderful pools or the restaurant as I know ive already said how much I love the food at this place so instead I will just say how marvelous the staff really are .They go way and beyond to help you if you have any concerns at all and to make sure you have an enjoyable holiday .So whether or not it is your first trip to Bali or your 50 th trip to this amazing island you are welcomed and made to feel special .I cannot emphasize what a wonderful crew of staff they are so I wont even single out anyone in particular as they all do a fantastic job .Cant wait to come back again in August for my husbands belated 60 th Birthday with many of my friends;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Karen H;Comfortable stay;We stayed in room with plunge pool. Room was spacious with small lounge,coffee table,desk., wardrobe, coffee and tea ,fridge Safe deposit box Bathroom was nice with huge shower always plenty of hot water. Not a lot of bench space on vanity. All very clean. Bed was comfortable. Location is good on the corner of Jalan Legian and Melasti street. Short walk to beach. The only gripe is from other patrons who put their pool towels on sun loungers and are nowhere to be seen...also could do with a small table and chairs outside near plunge pool. Overall a pleasant stay and would recommend particularly for families with small children.;4;0;1;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Michael O;Fantastic attention to detail.;This is my 3rd or 4th visit here, and they keep getting better. My most recent visit was 6 months ago & 3 or 4 of the staff remembered me by name. I was impressed. The hotel is only about 2 years old. The rooms are well eq pped and are kept very clean. Wifi works well. The location is excellent. There are 2 swimming pools and a pretty good gym. Massages at the hotel are very good. The food is good, including the buffet breakfast. And most importantly the service is outstanding.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;SydneyStringer;Great Location;Stayed here for the first time, have been to Bali many times. The hotel is very nice, but I think we just got a dudd room . It was always like damp, had a terrible musty smell even my pillow smelt musty. I'm not generally a whinger but just seemed this room didn't get enough air or something. Our kids stayed in a seperate room 2 doors up and their room seemed to be fine. Other than that it's in a great location easy access to anywhere in Bali;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Tomasz K;Nice place to relax;During my recent business trip to Kuta (yes… unlike others I was forced to work in Bali instead of enjoying the sun and sea) I stayed three nights at Mercure Legian. I got a nice and well maintained room. The staff at the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful, while the food in the restaurant was simply delicious. The hotel has two swimming pools, a fitness center and a spa. Apart from the hotel restaurant, there are a few other places to eat and shop in its nearest vicinity. The beach is just ca. 10 mins away by foot. It seems to be a good place to stay even for the holidays at a reasonable price.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Stacey T;Heaven;Absolutely loved this hotel. Couldn't fault the staff or the hotel itself. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Location wise it is perfect, close to shops and only 5 minute walk to the beach. The only complaint I had was similar to other people and that's the lack of furniture on balconies but if that's the only thing I have to complain about I think I'm pretty lucky. We will be back;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;R P;Mercure Bali Legian a great place to stay;A room with its own pool provided a great place to relax.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;EddySD;10 Days of Bliss;We stayed in the hotel for 10 days and we were completely happy with the hotel - both the facility and the staff. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to the beach and shops. It is also close to the airport and not far from the tourist attractions in Bali. We enjoyed this hotel and would not hesitate staying in the same hotel next time we are back in Bali. The pool was great although when we were there, some parents with out of control kids were there which made the pool experience less than ideal. Other than that, the place is a heaven in town.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;mycharlieboy;Great hotel in central location;All of the staff here made an effort to be friendly and helpful. Very central position. Rooms were clean.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Brett G;Great Hotel;This is a great hotel, stayed here for 10 nights in the roo that had its own plunge pool and the value for money was fantastic (booked 6 months in advance). Staff were very friendly and attending to all requests promptly. The hotel is very central and I found it easy to get around. My only issue was that the main pools weren't deep enough, however I didn't use them much because I had My own pool. Would stay here again no problem. Wifi the best of ever had and I've done allot of travelling.;4;1;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Cheryl S;Mercure Hotel legion outstanding 4 star;My Husband & I have just returned from Bali. We booked a balcony double bed room on the 2nd floor at the Mercure Hotel Legion. First night woke up to a flooded floor throughout the room, but this was no fault of the Hotel as it had very heavy rain. The management transferred us to the 5th floor balcony room over looking the swimming pool.It was perfect. Separate shower, very modern decore` and a wall mounted television with many channels including fox sports, Breakfast was plentiful and staff were extremely pleasant. Very clean throughout.I would highly recommend this hotel.for all ages. As we have stayed in many Hotels in Bali I know you would not be disappointed if you chose this one. I give it 10 out of 10. One swimming pool is on the ground floor, the other on the 4th floor.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Erica C;Very convienient hotel;Stayed here in January for the first time and really enjoyed our stay. Free standing shower which we prefer, two pools with the restuarant over looking one of them. Can be hard to find a sunbed next to the pool at times..more sunbeds please. The hotel is across the road from everything. Food, coffee at the Coffee Corner is only meters away with guards who stop the traffic and direct you safely across the roads. Markets, glass fronted stores and laundry all so close. The staff are helpful and the rooms are clean, not huge but adequate. We are staying there again in December.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;perth-girl26;Would stay again!;Hotel was lovely, clean, staff were very polite and helpful. Even though it's located on a fairly busy corner the noise didn't seem to come into the hotel. I would probably get a room with a balcony next time but this is only to make drying bathers easier and have somewhere to sit and relax. Money changer is directly across the road which is q te handy. Definitely would stay again;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Edward F;Not a resort but has all you need;We have not stayed here but we have had an extensive tour of the hotel, including viewing all the different room types. We are Accor members hence we called in a few times for a meal at Ancak Restaurant and lounge where we receive 50% discount. The restaurant and meals are very good, excellent service from the wait staff. Presentation and portion size of meals together with taste will not disappoint. Drink prices are on the high side but there again this is a four star hotel so q te normal. There is a great swimming pool with lounges and some garden plants and trees at ground level and also another roof top pool and sun beds and umbrellas and bar area, the spa and gym are in this area as well. if you want a bit of indulgence there are 6 or 8 s te rooms that have their own;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

Loved the location. Service was excellent After reading a few picky reviews we were really looking for negatives but were unable to find any. I used the spa which was fantastic. Our check in was smooth and the pools were lovely. Our favorite thing was our plunge pool which was a perfect temperature and sparkling clean.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;KanwarSL;Great stay! Family of 5 (kids n grandma). 6 days.;5 of us. Each enjoyed the hotel for their own reasons! Kids (6 & 9): 2 pools to choose from.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;dtcastle;Awesome;We recently had 9 nights at this fantastic hotel, from the moment we arrived we were well looked after Rooms were spacious and clean, food in restaurant was great.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Hayley C;Great location!;Nice, clean and very modern hotel. I was worried about it being noisey because the location is right in the middle of Legian surrounded by busy streets but I wasn't disturbed by any noise from the traffic. The cocktails were great. The buffer breakfast had everything. I loved the rooftop pool. The staff were good. All in all, my partner and I enjoyed our 4 night stay and would happily return! Perhaps the pools could use a few more sun lounges but that would be the only fault, everything else was great!;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;manda42;The best hotel in Legian by far;We had a superior room with private plunge pool. The room was impressive and the pool was beautiful. All of the hotel staff maintained an excellent standard of service and are definately a great team. Room service was great as our food was hot when it arrived. We had a fabulous stay here and will definately be staying here again.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;DDG2B;Would definitely stay again;Clean rooms, wonderful Balinese dinner and dance show, and best of all the staff exceeds all expectations. In particular Sunia in the restaurant area stood out as #1 - he was warm, attentive and proud of his country and hotel. Davita at the front desk was sweet and helpful as was Kris with our bags. My only suggestion to management would be to implement a no reserving lounge chairs by the pool policy. There are limited chairs available and people put their towels on chairs early in the morning to reserve and then leave them empty so it is very difficult to find an open chair - impossible after 10 am at the upstairs pool. I would stay at this hotel again, and recommend to others.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Ciara W;Beautiful hotel and staff;Myself and my partner stayed in the Mercure as a stop off before our trip over to Gili T.

We were also given a complementary j ce on check-in. Our stay was short but all staff were beautifully friendly and accommodating.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Lindon W;The total Bali package.;The hotel, its staff, it's rooms and all the amenities are absolutely first class. Nothing was too hard for the staff to organise and their first hand knowledge of island activities was sensational. The location of this hotel was ideal for us with everything at your fingertips. Can't believe it's not rated 5 stars. Made our first time in Bali a family holiday not soon forgotten. Will definitely return. Thanks heaps. Regards The Walkers.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;malteweege;Very good price / quality ratio;We stayed for 13 nights and had a pleasant stay. Hotel seems new and very well maintained.

The hotel itself was nice, always clean with helpful staff. We tended to go to the beach most days but used the roof pool twice and it was really nice, the food was lovely too.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Robert B;Exceptional Service;I don't think there is enough room for this review as the experience at the Mercure Bali Legian was exceptional. Our arrival was around lunch time before check in Time but staff gave us a welcome drink and voucher for the bar where we relaxed for around 40 mins. We were taken to our room on the 5th floor (546), and porters fussed over us carting our heavy luggage into the room, making sure we were comfortable with the aircon and use of tv etc we relaxed again. Room is very comfortable with queen bed, desk etc. bathroom is spacious with large shower ample hot water, great well lit vanity. Daily, staff were very friendly and helpful and always met our needs.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;BeniG;Right in the middle.;The Mecure Legain is one of the newer hotels in the Legian area of Bali. It is centrally located and an excellent spot to base your travels if your new to Bali. Situated on the western coast and a short 7 minute walk to the beach its the perfect spot to catch the sunset over the ocean. The beach is full of vendors offering a chair, a chat and a Bintang and for the more adventurous many of these vendors offer Surf lessons. The hotel is situated on one of the main tourist strips so you are never far from the restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Be prepared to bargain if you want a really good deal on shopping and services but if you dont like doing that then be prepared to pay double what you should..... in saying that things are pretty cheap anyway. There are no prices displayed;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Wez1978;Lovely Hotel!;We stayed here in January this year for 11 nights. Had 2 rooms booked at different times but they managed to get us side by side even though they were different room types. Extra points as well for putting a cot in both rooms for us so our baby could sleep in his grandparents room when we went somewhere. All the staff were super friendly, breakfast was always very good with a good range. We loved taking an afternoon/evening swim in the upstairs pool. So refreshing!

Nice room although housekeeping often didn't clean the room until the afternoon. The hotel has 2 pools which are a good size but often there are no seats/lounges by 10am so you may have to wait for someone to leave. The hotel is located on Legian street which is the main street and so close to shops, markets, restaurants etc. The room I had wasn't noisy at all (307).

I recommend this hotel because the location is just perfect, closed by shops in Kuta area and nice restaurants in Seminyak.

The grounds are immaculate and the pool areas lovely , I have heard that many people complain about the heat in the dining areas but hey this is Bali and it's warm !

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;jonathon h;Great value;Stayed here in February in an executive s te. The room was modern clean & very spacious, also the bathroom was q te roomy. Breakfast was included as is the case with most hotels in Bali nowadays, the quality & supply was aplenty. The roof top pool was great & had a good atmosphere. The only negative was our room was located to the front of the hotel & the night traffic was very loud. Overall a great hotel at a good price.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Karyna R;8 night Scoopon Voucher;I love everything about this hotel. From the moment we were picked up from the hotel by a helpful driver I knew we had made the right choice to book here. Every staff member is so welcoming and really go the extra mile to help with anything we need. Our voucher gave us access to full buffet breakfast every morning with free massages and dinners, the breakfast buffet is amazing and a great way to start to day. We stayed in a private plunge pool room and it was absolutely beautiful! I would definitely come back here 100 times over and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting bali for the first time, it's so central to everything we needed. Thank you so much Mercure for making our holiday great!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

The service was really good, in general all staff were very friendly and willing to help, especially Budi during the breakfast time. He was very polite and enthusiastic we could tell he really loves his job. Our room was always very clean and the bed and pillows extremely comfortable. Installations are new-like and in excellent conditions. We loved the terrace and the pool view. Definitely worth booking a room with a view. The AC in our room worked really good. Managers approached us during our stay to make sure we were having a pleasant stay. Everyone in the hotel are doing their absolute best to ensure you are having a good time.

The ground floor pool has more shade but unfortunately only about 12 sun lounges so you have to be q ck. The breakfasts had everything you would want and was always busy.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;aris_ramadhan;A remarkable runaway holiday;Everything was going well and I really enjoyed stayed at Mercure Legian. However, the only thing that missed to my experience was the VIP treatment for Le Club Gold member. Yes, I had got room upgrade and late checkout. But usually during my stay in other Accor property, there will be something more and personalised services for LeClub Gold member. I just didn't find that 'special experience' as LeClub Gold member during my stay at Mercure Legian as I get in other Accor hotels. Anyway, the staffs were very welcome and they deserve credits for their performances in helping and treating guests. What need to be improved are the a la carte menu in restaurant should be changing periodically and installing the AC in restaurant and lobby area will make it more comfortable due to hot;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

The first time we stayed in the Deluxe Room with Private Pool on the ground floor. Room was lovely, spacious and very clean. The private pool is small but really nice and private. We recently stayed in a Standard room on level 4, it was also nice especially for the price that we paid. The hotel has two pools which are both beautiful and pretty q et. Our only issues we've encountered with this hotel is the service. We have a bad experience for both of our stays. The check-in is extremely slow and staff are unfriendly and not interested. There was a sign in the lobby for daiq ri happy hour between 5-7pm which we were excited to try. Unfortunately when we went to the restaurant by the pool at 6pm, we waited 20 minutes to be served,;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Close proximity to market shops, laundry, money changer and plenty of restaurants. $2 Taxi fare approximately to Kuta or Seminyak and enjoyed our nightly drinks at ""Josephs"" on the beach which was about a 5/6 minute walk along narrow footpaths and busy traffic street.

Grip 3- Snacks in the Poole bar were awful, tasteless waste of money. Chosen not to eat in main restaurant after the Poole bar feed. Staff were great, I guess they are under The pump.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Bruno035;The Owner needs to put his hand in his pocket!;I have reviewed this property many times and I'm always happy with the care and attention I get from the staff and management, however it is apparent that the owner is has put the hand brake on some simple solutions to make this hotel really great, not just good. The issues with lack of fans in the restaurant and reception has not been addressed nor the surface around the Pool, which is downright dangerous when wet. The handicap access to the restaurant is also still not completed. Better isolation of the smokers is req red. And just on a personal note, why isn't there Australia Plus on the TV choice ?

It was clean, modern and a good size. The location is perfect as you are close to restaurants, bars and only a short walk from Kuta, yet still away from the craziness. The walk to the beach is only 10 minutes as well. My last villa in Bali did not live up to my expectation. It was pricey, dirty and creepy... so my partner and I packed our bags and came straight back to the Mercure Legian for our last 2 nights of the holiday, and we couldn't have been happier!

You can easily walk to nearby restaurants if you don't mind walking in the heat. The bed was super comfy. The air conditioner worked well. The room was pretty q et. Once you closed the door you could only hear muffled outside noise. The room is super dark with nice thick block out curtains. The deluxe plunge pool room was a generous size with a small seating area next the bed. The pool (downstairs one) gets some sun during the day so it's nice and warm,but still refreshing, and its a good depth (1.2m) so you can float in it all day without wanting to get out.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Lulufluff;Central location;The hotel looks very new with an open reception. The place is clean and staff polite. When checking in if you don't have a credit card to have a security deposit put on it, they do ask for 2 million rupiah as a deposit and you get it back at the end when you checkout. There is a money changer across the road. There are 2 pools, one on ground floor not far from reception and one on 4th floor. Ground floor one is bigger. On 4th floor there is a fitness centre and they do offer free Yoga. The rooms are nice. The bathroom has a glass window so you can see in to the bedroom, but there is a blind you can pull down. The fridge has a mini bar but it comes empty so you can ring if you want something from the mini bar. This room didn't have a balcony so there is no where to hang;5;0;0;1;0;1;0

Dust sitting on glass shelf over minibar cabinet and hairs on bathroom floor. when we first walked into our rooms. Dust still there when we checked out. Requests for extra towels & pillows were brought by personnel who smelled HEAVILY of cigarette smoke. Hence you can tell how the extra towels & pillows smelled like! replenishment of shower gel & shampoo non existant -had to make requests and housekeeping doesn't seem to pick up phone.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;catherine w;Fourth trip now and still improving;We have just come back from our Easter break at Mecure Legian and have loved everything about it . Improvements have been umbrellas on the fourth floor poolside , balcony furniture has started coming and I believe there is more arriving and also the addition of fans in the restaurant which of course never seem enough in such a hot country and with the restaurant being open to the pool always seems hot unless you go down to breakfast extremely early and request a fan by your table at lunch or dinner ! Congratulations to the staff for organising these things as I know they have to ask the owners repeatedly for guest requests to make things even better for us when we are there on holidays .

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Denisedew;Fantastic !!!;As a single women travelling with two daughters for our first trip to Bali I picked the Mercure as it is an international chain and I have stayed at Mercure's/Accors before. I am so glad I did... Location is good and professional money changer right across the road (professional with security and good rate) We had a plunge pool room with a King and an extra rollaway bed. (Thanks Dyah for easily organising this) All the facilities in the room were great and aircon works well. Security is great. They are all very helpful and take note of number plates when you leave with driver or taxi and check all the cars before letting them in... they even stopped the crazy Bali traffic for me to cross the road. Breakfast - no complaints - Western and local buffet with egg station and;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;David_Bosanquet;Silent day in Mecure Bali Legain;We enjoyed our stay in this hotel. We received very professional & friendly service. All of the staff were very friendly & willing to help. The hotel was very clean in all aspects. The hotel is just over 12 months old and has all of the modern facilities you would expect from a new hotel. We were surprised at reception when checking in to be told we were staying in the hotel over a very special religious day in Bali… Nyepi day (or silent day). Its an annual event on the Hindu calendar that all of Bali recognises. No one in Bali is allowed on the streets anywhere on this day for 24 hours. This 24 curfew applies to tourists as well req ring all hotel guests to remain in the hotel for 24 hours. The hotel functioned as usual with meals etc but on reduced hours. The hotel was well;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

This is my 3rd stay here. i highly recommended it to my family and friends. The hotel is always spotless and the facilities are great, i love the choice of having 2 pools. I stayed in a king deluxe balcony room on level 2,the room was clean and the air-conditioning excellent, the balcony was huge with an outdoor setting and day bed. The hotel is opposite the commonwealth bank, has a great BMC money exchange next to Grandma's hotel on the other side. Now what really tops of this hotel is the staff!!!! I am always greeted with a smile and a lot of the staff actually know me by name. The professionalism they show is second to none.

The rooms are nice and clean, the pools looked great and the staff are very friendly. The beach is about a 10minute walk away.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Fnick_Perth;Brilliant;My wife and I booked a 10 night stay at the Mercure Legian based on a Scoopon deal. Our expectations were not super high as the deal was almost too good to be true, however once we got there we were pleasantly surprised by a wonderful centrally located hotel on the corner of Jilan Legian and Melasti. We were familiar with the area having previously stayed at the Pullman down the road, so the corner location did not phase us. As a mater of fact, the corner location became an added bonus for us because of the Neypi Day celebrations that occurred during our stay. I have read many reviews where hotel staff are praised for their customer service skills. The Mercure Legian is no exception. Absolutely every customer touch point was a pleasant experience, from the driver who picked us;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Paige13;GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY;Had a girls holiday here. The hotel is located in a perfect place for access to shops, restaurants, spas and 5 minutes walk to the beach. The two pools are good. Top floor adult area with sun beds, pools side bar and infinity pool over looking the street. The area had music playing most of the time, not to loud as there are a lot of room balconies overlooking the area. Very relaxing area. Next to the pool is the gym, with free yoga on some mornings, the kids club and spa area. The bottom floor has the lagoon pool with the kids pools next to the restaurant/ bar area. The pool service at this area was not as attentive as the top pool. Pools are open until 10pm at night, which is good for those wanting that late swim.

One on the 4th floor has pool service and serves tapas and drinks, fair few pool lounges and seating areas. They issue a towel card and then you still have to sign them in and out, very strange. The spa is set out very nice and has a very relaxing atmosphere. The restaurant is very hot and could do with some ceiling fans. The meals were nice and reasonably priced.

At first the pool was green but that was q ckly fixed when I complained. The room was lovely and roomy with a great bathroom. All staff were friendly and accomodating when we asked for outdoor furniture and ice etc. The only problem we had was getting our room clean, out of 10 nights I had to ask 5 times, at 3pm, to have the room cleaned, just a little annoying.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;mikeAussie;Excellence thi name is mercure;I have stayed at many hotel in Bali and this would have to be the best. My wife and I left her kids home and went for a four night getaway from it all. We were treated like important people as soon as we climbed out of the transport vehicle from the airport. The greetings continued to the seamless checkout and the escort to our room. The room was a deluxe balcony, no pool view as we were on the jalan legian side of the hotel, but this was just fine for us. The room is a good side, the bed is firm but not too firm, the pillows were on the soft side but this was q ckly rectified by housekeeping. The bathroom was a good size also with the hotel supplying soap, body wash, shampoo and conditioner in small tubes - these had a really nice scent to them but we needed a little more so;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

The lobby waterfall was VERY noisy from our balcony, was difficult to have a conversation when it was on. Shower smelled a bit when the water was first turned on and the temperature of the water fluctuated noticeably. Fit and finish was a bit ordinary in places, little things really like the bathroom sink being smaller than the cabinet, bathroom door handle came off, nothing major just a personal observation.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Stacey;Enjoyable Stay;Have found the service fantastic. No swim up bar but the staff with bring you drinks while in the pool if you drink them at the edge of the pool. We had a ground floor room near the pool with windows that don't open - had at times left the room very damp & the floor slippery. Also would have loved a door to get straight to the pool. The shower is clear glass so you can see through from the bed but it does have a roller up blind in the shower that is a little mouldy. Despite these little q rks it has been a very enjoyable stay & would stay here again.

Last August I became an Accor member & stayed in the Pullman Legian & thought it was good. This year I noticed Mercure Legian & decided to give it a try as I got a fantastic deal. Got picked up from airport & check in was q ck & smooth. Superior King Room on 3rd floor was very spacious & so was the bathroom. Got a view of a side street but couldn't complain for the price we paid & we're not much in our room anyway. Was clean & bed was very comfortable. Small note, shower door didn't close fully so water did spill out a bit. Breakfast was good. Not sure why there are complaints about it being the same everyday;5;0;0;0;1;1;1

The pools are lovely but are deceiving, they are rather small but do the job. The down stairs pool is more shaded and ideal for the kids, while the upstairs pool is far better for relaxing with a nice bar, loungers, gym and spa.

We arrived late at night, check in was q ck and efficient and we were directed to our room. The room was everything they had stated but it was on the second floor and immediately entering the room we were hit with the street noise of traffic and entertainment from a venue across the street even though all the doors and windows were closed.

The mini fridge comes empty awaiting your own beverages and keeps things nicely chilled. Breakfast was more than fine with an extensive choice of asian and western choices. Whilst i am not a big cocktail drinker, those that I had here were by far the best I have had in Bali if not anywhere and were most reasonably priced, particularly the 2 for 1 during happy hour. The staff are brilliant and attentive. Opposite the hotel is Orange Laundry;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

As the location is tremendous on the corner of Melasti and Legian Streets. Real easy to go anywhere from it. This has already been my 3rd visit and the staff and management are great. The GM is a real go getter, however the Owners have hamstrung the Hotel's true potential by not supplying the funding to complete a few outstanding projects such as balcony furnishing, replacing the ineffective fridges and providing fans or air conditioning to the dining and reception areas. I can across the Owners rep's while I was there and they assure me the improvements are on the way. If they are good to their word then put this hotel at the top of your list .

All your staff were so lovely and attentive and went out if your way to help you abd alwways happy (and give me poolside garlic bread!). Breakfast was nice each day. Only things that could be improved was I had a lovely pedicure in the hotel spa bit could do with some new colour options as I was very limited. Your poolside drinks were also abit questionable. I had a lovely milkshake, a questionable testing cosmopolitan and I thought Ide be annoying and see uf the drinks guy knew how to make iced mocha expecting him to say no but he got me excited and said yes.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;surfing70;Great stay;Stayed for 8 days mid January. We had 2 rooms side by side on the 5th floor. A double & 2 singles in the other. Both over looking the lower pool. Rooms were great, clean & had everything we needed. Internet was good, room service was great. The staff are very friendly & helpful. Food in the restaurant was a high standard. Both pools were great especially the top one with the view & drinks. My wife even had a birthday cake bought to the door with 2 staff members singing happy birthday. Thanks Mercure Legian for a great family holiday.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Roger Weston;What a great holiday;What a great 10 days. Although this hotel has only been open just over 1 year and has a few teething problems none of them could spoil our stay there. The room with a private plunge pool was fantastic. The service to the room was first rate and if we needed anything at all we just asked and it was provided.We travelled on a scoopon deal and used the food vouchers for the hotel, we were surprised about the high quality and choices we had available. Overall the hotel was very friendly and welcoming perfectly positioned for exploring Kuta and Legian and we will stay there again.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Alison S;Modern hotel, friendly staff;All the staff at the Legian were very friendly, and couldn't do enough to please. The room was clean, excellent shower and bathroom, view of the pool. Efficient air conditioning. The only criticism is that there were no fans in the dining or bar areas, which were stifling when we visited in December.;4;0;0;1;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Tina W;Great value!;Stayed in a plunge pool room. Room 120. Beautifully appointed room and spacious for our 9 day stay. Aircon worked really well. Pool was a perfect temperature. The little fridge struggles but we found if you kept the cupboard door opened and pulled the fridge forward to allow air circulate it worked a treat. Had a few drinks and one lunch. All ok. Nothing amazing but not bad either. We didnt get breakfast with our stay instead choosing to try out the cafes around us. See other review for Coffee Corner. ..so good! Used the upstairs pool once but found the pool too hot and also no shaded lounges around. I understand they are working on this. Downstairs pool was little cooler but not enough lounges. We didnt bother to try either again as we had our great little plunge pool which by;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;nicriggs;Great location, new hotel in Legian’s action-packed area;We booked our stay at the Mercure hotel Legian taking advantage of a package including daily breakfast, cocktails and massages, 1 free lunch and 1 free dinner, and an upgrade to a room with a balcony, which was great value for money. The hotel is in a great location, smack-bang in the middle between Kuta and Seminyak on the main drag- approximately 15 minutes walk in either direction-, with lots of shopping and eating opportunities around. The beach is 5 minutes walk away, which is no big deal unless it’s critical for you to have the beach right on your doorstep. For the walk to Seminyak it is also nicer and much cooler to go via the beach, rather than along the busy road. If you arrive at the hotel after dark, the front entry is not very well lit-up, which feels rather weird,;4;1;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Ginette0512;Convenient;Very clean and well maintained hotel. Staff were very obliging and friendly. Rooms airconditioned and comfy, poorly lit but kept mossies & other insects away. Pool/s(ground floor off restaurant and in 4th floor) very clean and well serviced, great place too cool down in and lots of seating or lounge areas to relax. Lobby and restaurant needs fans or something but openness of plan doesn't allow. Food could be raised a notch or two for variety. Hotel need to promote their $15 buffet dinners better. Close to shopping areas and central to nearby areas of Bali via walking or cheap taxi ride. Hotel did meet our needs as travellers despite the minor items.;5;0;1;1;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Alexandra N;An amazing 10 night stay;My partner and I stayed 10 nights here and I have to say it was perfect! When we arrived they gave us cold face washers and a nice cold j ce which was perfect after arriving and it being so hot! The aircon in our room was perfect, our room was spotless and it was perfectly cleaned every day. The service was just outstanding and you felt like royalty. Every time you get back to the hotel there's always someone to open the door for you. The security is fantastic and leaves you feeling so safe. When you want to cross the road outside the security at the hotel stops the traffic so you can cross! Everyone greets you with a big smile and are all so friendly. They are all so great to have a chat with, especially our new friend Anas the bartender on the 4th floor at the pool bar. The;5;0;0;1;1;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Amanda S;Week away, minus kids;Stayed here on a great deal, our 10th visit, generally stay in Legian, but have stayed in Ubud, Lovina and Candi Dasa as well. Upgraded to a pool room and if you can afford it, would recommend this. Pool areas can get busy (plus smokers if you're a non-smoker), so it was awesome to be able to get away from all that. Pool rooms are also located away from street, so there is no street noise at all. Location was central and walking distance to everything, facilities still new, so great condition, but we did notice many rooms without balconies and many that had them, still had no outdoor furniture, which would be a bit disappointing if you wanted to sit outside. Staff were friendly and helpful. Great choice for couples (with pool) or girls shopping trip or boys away, not sure;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;AlanSee;Very good location;It's located at the busy Legian street and eateries are not a problem at all. Bed is comfy, so as the room.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;SilvSL;New hotel good location;Heard about this new hotel from a family member so decided to try it while in Bali. It's located near the trendy Seminyak area, within walking distance to shops and cafes. A plus if you like to venture around. The hotel itself is clean and well set. We got a room with a plunge pool, which is lovely, just dip in when the weather feels a bit too warm. Bed is comfortable and bathroom is spotless. Breakfast selections are extensive and food is very tasty. Being an Accor member, we also received complimentary refreshing welcome drinks for two. Staff is helpful and courteous. Service is q ck too, never have to wait more than a min or two to get assistance. Internet is available throughout. All in all, a great experience at Mercure Bali Legian.;5;0;1;1;1;0;1

The pool is nice and my kids love it. The location is just perfect if you like to do things in Legian or Kuta area. Its just in the centre of the Legian. The breakfast is nice.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;AriW966;Good Hotel Experience in The Location;Great location: close to the beach about 7 minutes walk, and close to everything else you ever need during your stay in Bali. It was year end holiday and that is Bali most busy time of the year. The night before the hotel was contacted me asking my arrival time, and later on a separate email asking my credit card detail. I have never been asked for credit card details before (other than in booking system), but they explain that it was peak time so they need to do that to everybody coming on Dec 31 to secure one night rate. Later midday when I arrived I noted Legian and Kuta roads were closed in anticipation for the new year. The closure was up to early morning new year. Lucky that I arrive in the morning, otherwise, it will be very difficult to go from airport to the hotel by;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Wanda F;New hotel, perfect location;We stayed at this hotel on 29th of December for 1 night. We chose this hotel not only because we are member of Accor Le Clubs but also because of its location which is near to everything...you just need to walk a couple of minutes to find restaurants or cafe or going for shopping.....but if you'd like to stay in a hotel that near the beach...you will find a lot of other hotels that is closer to the beach...;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Joe M;A great place to stay;We are just coming to the end of a great stay at this hotel. Only one year old and very convenient to all of the places of interest in Legian, Kuta and Seminyak. The rooms with verandas are great with chairs and table and the most comfortable bed. Twin beds joined together are fine. Q lts are fully enclosed (not sheet/q lt/sheet and folded down) which I like and not too thick. Air conditioning is great. Fridges are not so good as the do not cool down drinks enough. The Level 4 pool is nice but very warm - like a bath - as it is in direct sunlight all day. Drinks menu by the pool is fine but I had to make sure I stood and watched them make cocktail as once, they tried to use one measure of alcohol for 2 drinks. I had learnt this from fellow travellers.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jessica R;A pleasant stay!;I stayed at the Mercure Legian for a couple of nights. The room I was given was a tiny and cosy one tucked somewhere in a corner. The housekeeping deserves praise as they were not only prompt but efficient as well. Enjoyed dining at the restaurant as the food was tasty and reasonably priced. Breakfast is average tho gh and worth a miss! We were always greeted by warm smiles even though the place was short-handed. The spa on the other hand could do with lots of improvements. I felt my spa treatment was a rushed job as the therapists had appointments back to back. Was left feeling rather disappointed. Overall, I enjoyed the convenience of the location.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;THEWOODIES;Wonderful stay in a king room with private plunge pool;We stayed at this lovely property last week, we had a gorgeous deluxe king room with a private plunge pool. The amenities and toiletries were great. Bed was comfortable to sleep in and the pillows soft and fluffy The room was always cleaned and linen changed. AMAZING fast FREE WIFI, but no mini bar, (just fridge to put your own drinks into) not that we needed one as the drinks are very reasonable and there is happy hour in the roof top bar /pool area between 5pm and 8pm with 2 for 1 cocktails. The hotel is on the corner of Legian & Melasti Sts very close to everything, with a good safe money changer across the road. The hotel location is perfect, (just 5 mins walk to Legian beach) lots of bars and restaurants, also all the markets and shops are right at the front doorstep. The;5;0;1;0;0;1;1

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;LaurensiusG;Good location but unfortunately the rooms were not ready.;They said that we can check in at 2 pm, but in reality when we came there around 3 pm, th front desk stated that the rooms we ordered were still in a cleaning process and we had to wait for an hour or so. That is so unfortunate and clearly a dissapointment for us. Other than that and the fact that one of the rooms was dim and the air was a little bit too damp for our liking, the 2 rooms we've booked were overall great and comfortable. We got the deluxe rooms with balcony but there are no chairs. The other balconies have chairs. What a waste, what's the point on having a balcony if you can't sit there right?Breakfast was great and on top of that, my daughters really enjoyed the pool and the free yoga class that Mercure offered.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Angie M;Beautiful Hotel;My teenage daughter and I stayed for 7 nights, the deluxe room with balcony was perfect for us. We loved our room. The rooftop pool was not finished when we visited but the main pool and adjoining restaurant was perfect for lazy afternoons when we didn't want to venture far. Hotel is very close to everything, with a good safe money changer across the road. While we were here I unfortunately became very ill from something I ate in town, and the staff at the hotel were amazing In assisting me get to hospital and arranging the local tourist doctor to visit my room on numerous occasions. As I was alone with my daughter, this could have been a very stressful experience, but they helped make sure my daughter was happy and that we always had what we needed.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Debora O;Short Stay, but worth to pay!;Stayed 1 night in here back in March 2015. We had a room upgrade to a nice s te with lounge, with 2 TV inside the room, which made both children and parents happy to watch our own channel. The hotel has 2 outdoor pools, one on ground level & the other one is a roof top pool. Both are great, the children really enjoyed swimming in both pools. There's a small kids corner room on the same level with the roof top pool, but the toys & books were more s table for very young children (I would say under 5 yo). Buffet breakfast was really nice and authentic, a mix between Indonesian & western style. I won't hesitate to recommend this hotel to my families & friends, especially family with young children.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Peter H;Great Hotel, Staff are Very Pleasant;"The Hotel was great, staff very friendly and in a good location. The rooms were good, but recognise that a ""Superior King Room"" is just their basic room, although very comfortable. My main issue with the Hotel was that the ""Public Areas"" ie restaurants and bars areas were very hot. Whilst we were there in the Summer, I believe that the ""public areas should have fans at least. The Bar area had a ""Dyson Fan"" but unless you stood next to it, it was not effective. For a new hotel, I would have thought that some cooling would be available in the Public areas ( no complaints about the rooms). Some rooms had a balcony but no outdoor chairs, table etc. When we inq red they said ""we dont have spare chairs etc""";4;0;0;1;1;0;0

One staff member was really helpful with the delay of our holiday because of the Ash Clouds over Bali. They were happy to change dates several times for us and always wished us the best to meet the next flight. The other staff member was hopeless. Tried to cancel our booking as my girlfriend who booked the hotel was not coming now then stuffed up the new dates. Like you will be arriving with us now on the 12th and leaving on the 9th. I am glad they did change the dates for us as some hotel in Bali said you cant change the dates and to claim it on your insurance.

We used a scoopon and they wouldnt let us order our voucher food pool side which was a shame as I dont think it would have mattered to get it at upstairs pool but you get that.

I will say that if you book a room for 3 people make sure you get 2 beds... When we arrived they expected us to sleep in a king bed and when we argued they tried to charge us an extra $36 per night for the roll away.

Being just 1 year old, the hotel facilities etc are q te new and not yet showing wear and tear. 2 pools provide ample swimming options to escape the heat and humidity. Dining options are limited to one restaurant, but food quality and service were fantastic. The only issue with the restaurant is that it is open air (nice for ambience), but very hot and stuffy for those not tolerant of the high heat and humidity. No fans at all to assist with relief from the heat. Great location for shopping (just a few minutes walk to Garlic Lane shops etc).";5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;catherine w;Getting better all the time !;For the price you pay to stay at Mecure Legian you can't go wrong . Excellent staff , two pools great rooms and restaurant and modern gym with new Life Fitness eq pment .There are a few things they are still working on like the balcony furniture which is coming . The bar fridges aren't very cold but happy hour drinks from 5 to 7 are very cheap . Two cocktails for $10 and they are very good not like the cheap ones you see on the streets . They could do with a towel rail on the balcony s to dry beach wear etc . The hotel will be having their first anniversary in December so they are still ironing out a few things but all in all can't fault it and I have three more holidays booked for next year so I obviously love the place . Also the restaurant is great and especially the staff;4;1;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Kyle W;Lovely Hotel, Wonderful Staff;After the first few days we were unhappy with a few small things (aircon and fridge) but after speaking with the manager he rectified these issues by moving us from the Delux Balcony room to a Plunge Pool room free of charge. He was more than happy to help and ensure we had a good honeymoon. We will return to the hotel.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Peg D;Beautiful Bali;We had an enjoyable stay in the Mecure Bali Legian. Great position and very comfortable bed and pillow which allowed us to enjoy a great night sleep after very active days swimming exploring and enjoying all that Bali has to offer. Staff were amazing - very helpful and welcoming. This was our third trip to Bali and we will be back! One suggestion which would be helpful is if one of the rooms was set aside and made available specifically for those who were catching the very early for example 1am morning flights for showers, hairdryer, lounge TV etc. We experienced this when we stayed at the Ibis in Singapore and it was so wonderfully convenient particularly in the hot, humid weather.;4;0;0;1;0;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;zeeteR002;Amazing!;We stayed here in april 2015 just after this place had opened....amazing. It was our first time in Bali and they certainly helped to make it memorable. Rooms are super spacious and they will help you with anything you can think of, even if sometimes the language barrier was hard, they try so far and always pulled through. I will be back next year, thanks heaps Mercure Legian!;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

The staff are so helpful and welcoming..have really loved our stay. Congratulations to all the staff for their excellent service. We come to Bali at least 5 times per year and this has been one of the best. I do have one major issue.. Noise, we were in room 372, my advice if you get that room ask to be moved.! I don't need q et to be able to sleep but the sound of loud motorbikes is relentless. I was able to handle this but the real issue with room 372 is it is directly beneath the gym. When people are in there at 6 am and they start dropping Dumbbells on the floor it's like a war zone.. I advised management about this and recommended a sign be placed in the gym not;5;1;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;mrmillard;Ash Cloud Recovery;Was stuck in Bali for a week and could not of been more comfortable staying here. Stayed in two different rooms and the beds were the comfiest I'd slept in since being in Bali. The only negatives there was, were the shower drain smelling and not enough english speaking channels on the TV (only a problem if you're stuck in Bali with no money). Other than that this hotel was exceptional!!;4;0;0;0;1;0;1

Great room with good water pressure shower, great infinity pool, good breakfast and easy access to the Legian street. Very strategic location close to Seminyak too as well as close to local offers (dewi sri street) and only walking distance to Kuta beach. Not too expensive to stay and you get a lot exposure to surrounding area.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;JenineMandurah;Lovely hotel, enjoyed our stay;Well presented hotel, we had a plunge pool room. Pool was clean however note that there is no privacy from the rooms above, perhaps roofing to small part above pool would provide some privacy. Friday BBQ on the rooftop was worth going to, food was fresh and tasty. Both pools are cleaned and maintained, staff are lovely deal with throughout. Location is in heart of Legian so well positioned. Only thing that lacked was we had to request our room to be cleaned and made up after 4 pm, but they attended straight away. Well done to the Management, I would recommend this hotel and I would stay again.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;tamara s;Boutique Reosrt;Just spent 10 days at the Mercure. The staff were really friendly and the service as great. Breakfast was a buffet style but lacked a few things, one thing I can say is the bacon was crap! The overall style and design was fantastic, checkin was seamless and our connecting room was ready when we arrived early. The rooms were clean but every time you turned on the shower you had to let it run for a while, sewerage smell wasn't pleasant! The noise from the street was horrendous t got used to it after a few nights, maybe fitting double glass would have been better! The pool area were great as well, always chairs apart from the 390 Germans that arrived because of flight cancellations?! It was located in a great spot, one block to Legian beach and a short taxi ride ($2) to Seminyak.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;BenadeoArkady;Great Hotel Near Kuta;Overall great hotel. It is located in area that has less crowded and traffic. The Legian also has a strategic value in terms of location because it is near to seminyak or kuta area. The room condition is clean though not that spacious for me and my family. The service quality also q te nice. It has 2 swimming pool and they also provide some pool eq pment that you or your children can use. And me and my family also like the breakfast that they served.;4;1;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Silviu L;A very good hotel, close to the most wonderful beach in Bali;We had to stay some few nights at this hotel because our fly was concealed due to the voolcano eruption. The room was large enough for two persons and looked clean. The minibar was empty and the bath amenities were minimal. Each piece of furniture has different style and design, which was a little unpleasant. No posibilities to open a window for fresh air. The hotel has an unfriendly politics with the smokers – any special place for them, excepting near the floor pool. The breakfast was not too divese but reasonable. The staff is very friendly and efficient, a little too slow during the breakfast. The hotel is situated 7-8 min. far from an unbelievably nice beach, and many shops, bars and restaurants are close to it. The pools were very crowded almost all the time. Hi fi;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;-tourist865-;Very comfortable and pleasant stay, really nice staff, only minor points to mention;Stayed here 7 nights. Good location, 10minutes walk to nightlife, beach, and restaurants. Gym was adequate, kids club is a small room with nice toys but req res parent supervision. Well appointed modern rooms, great pool area but very slippery tiles around the pool. Rooms are slow to clean, not before 2pm. Breakfast has great selection of food, very attentive and friendly staff. One morning the hash browns at breakfast had been refried from the day prior which made them inedible. Not being the fault of staff, rather the lack of training provided to them, sometimes problem solving skills were lacking. For example, no milk one morning at breakfast, but nobody took the initiative to get any, or mention the fact when arriving for breakfast. Also no offer of discount for paid;4;0;1;1;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Bea Bea;Loved every second!;My boyfriend and I stayed at Mercure Bali Legian for 8 nights in October 2015 and we loved it. The hotel is beautiful, the pools were beautiful and the staff were beautiful! The staff are really professional, helpful and most importantly friendly. We ate at the restaurant every morning for breakfast and there was a huge variety of things to choose from including good coffee! We lovely the pool bar and the guys there were so great to chat too while having some pree drinks and cocktails. Our room was cleaned and restocked everyday. The place was always being cleaned which was good to see things including the lifts, the pools and even the railings seemed to be scrubbed everyday. We also had a hour massage at the spa everyday. The spa rooms are cool, full of brand new lay down beds;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Cacindra P;Modern, nice hotel;This was our first stay at the Mercure, on booking in they couldn't locate our booking and due to it being very late they didn't make life hard just moved on and sorted it out. We had a deluxe balcony room which had a large balcony overlooking the main entrance which was lovely although if ou are a light sleeper the sound from the water feature could be annoying but was of no issue to us. There was a few missives but nothing a bit of insect spray didn't fix thanks to housekeeping. Beds were very comfy, bathrooms clean bit awkward to get into the shower as the door opens into the shower so you had to turn the shower head towards the wall so as not to get water everywhere. Breakfast was nice eggs ordered to your liking and freshly made j ce of your choice. Great coffee best hub;5;0;0;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;D M;Better than I expected - Considering !!!!!!;Stayed for 5 night (Oct 11- 15) via package deal that has been mentioned before. Room was on 5th level overlooking 4th floor pool which we requested. Was very nice but afternoon sun was a killer as stated by others ! Why just one chair - honestly... Breakfast was OK for what we paid and yes it is noicey but you should expect that knowing it's location. Meals in hotel (only had one) was very ordinary. We moved to the Pullman ( as Accor member) for our last two nights and paid over $200 a night (RR $330 +) and the room and whole experience was not as good as the Mecure in my opinion. Pullman is totally overated and I have stayed a few times now. Oh! music is modern BUT they need to change the same music that repeats and repeats !;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;JAJAYtravellers;Comfort and Location;We chose to spend our last night at the Mercure ( as an Accor Member), for its location for last minute shopping in Bali. The hotel lobby is amazing and has a wonderful cooling breeze way. We booked a private plunge pool room which are located on the ground floor. The room faciliites were very clean and well presented, the pool area had a little area to sit but the cushions were not the righ size for two people to relax on and were actually uncomfortable. The garden was becoming q te overgrown and encrouched into the small pool area and the poor plants were getting a dose of pool water when two people were in the pool. The pool area is not private as it is would be in full view of anyone staying in the units above you, there are pergolas that the plants are trying to climb but;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Sam P;Excellent experience;Myself & girlfriend just spent a week at Mercure legian, we had booked the deluxe plunge pool room. This room was outstanding, you're own secluded pool was unreal, for a fraction more of the cost. Although the two public pools were nice, we didn't use them once, too crowded etc. I would highly recommend staying in this room, was always excited to come home to the room. The hotel itself was excellent, customer service was exceptional, and the staffs assistance to book tours & dinner was great. The only negative thing i could say was they do not have much of a Gluten Free menu, for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. My girlfriend is celiac, it would have been nice to stay at the hotel one night and have dinner there. Other than that, great stay, close to everything & easy to get;4;0;0;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;v b;Modern, clean hotel;We stayed for two nights in a deluxe king room with a balcony. The room was ready when we checked in & we were given a welcome drink & cold washer while checking in. All the staff were polite & helpful. The room was clean, nice and a good size although being modern it didn’t have much of a “Bali” feel to it. The bed was fairly firm. The shower had a glass panel through to the room with a blind you could pull down. Water pressure was good. Housekeeping was excellent and our room was made up early in the day. We chose this type of room after looking at the photos of the rooms on their website, and were disappointed with the balcony as we were expecting a large balcony with furniture, instead the balcony was not nearly as large as in the photos and had no furniture on;4;0;0;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;SrApples;Room for improvement;Stayed for five nights. Nice clean new hotel. Location was convenient for shopping and eating out. Rooms, need better lighting and are small. Balcony had no furniture so had to obtain our own. Seal on balcony door broken, so mosq to's could come in at night, requested attention to this, but never eventuated. Buffet breakfast was only ok in comparison to other resorts but definitely enough to fill you up. Pool area's are not huge. Ground pool, is q eter and surrounded by more greenery than upper floor pool. No umbrellas by upper floor pool, which made it hot if laying out by pool all day. Construction going on around hotel. Would suggest looking elsewhere if wanting hotel with typical tropical bali feel. We were happy enough with our stay but would not likely stay there again.;4;0;1;0;0;1;0

I would suggest you obtain a room with Balcony. It has an in room safe, small fridge, spacious shower area. Tea and Coffee making facilities. Breakfast is great. I wished the hotel provided two light weight Balinese chairs and a small table for the Balcony. 10 minute walk to the beach.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Tiffanyf1994;7 night stay;Good location and service. Room was spacious and clean. The 2 pools were lovely with great music, food and cocktails served throughout the day. Only negative experience we had at this hotel was with one of the young male room service staff, who would occasionally deliver my meal to my room and would repeatedly follow me into my room when I would go to get my purse, even though he was asked to wait at the door. It made me feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable, I believe this may have just been a miscommunication due to the language barrier. Other than this it was a lovely stay. The welcome refreshments were especially a nice touch.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;kevin4nivek;Nice Location, Great Staff but Expensive Food;First of all the location is great. Just 5-6 mins walk to Legian Beach. Lots of restaurants and shopping outlets surrounding this property. Money exchange outlets as well just opposite to the hotel. Very beautiful lobby and comfortable rooms. Once we checked in, no bell boy service was provided, then we never asked for it as well. Room had a nice greeting letter welcoming us but sadly it was addressed to some other person. Hotel staff was great and greets you whenever you pass by them, but they should concentrate more on these minute details. In room dining menu was really expensive hence never cared to check the restaurant menu. Breakfast was included in our stay and I would say it was pretty good.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Martin R;A wonderful place to stay;I have just had an eight night stay at Mercure Bali Legian and enjoyed every minute of my stay. Great room, great facilities and wonderful staff. It would be unfair of me to single out any staff members by name as all of them give great service and are very obliging. A pleasure to see their smiles and warm greetings when entering and leaving the hotel each day. I noticed people from all walks of life, older, younger, singles, couples, families all seeming to really enjoy their stay. The spa is highly recommended for a very good massage. Of course, it is more expensive than the local spas and massage places, but truly worth the extra. One highlight of my stay was inviting a friend to join me at the Friday evening BBQ held poolside on the 5th floor. For the price of IRP150,000 ++;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Bruno035;4th Visit;As a repeat customer it's great to see the continued improvement under the new G.M Phil Read. The service from the staff is now as good as any comparable Hotel in Legian. Special mention to Desak at the front desk. Value remains right up there and as a new Hotel it's good to have modern facilities. Not the tired old hotels nearby. Location is still hard to beat everything you want for shopping and food is very easy walking distance. However it would be even better if the Owner would support the Hotel and install effective fans at the Front Desk and in the Dining Area. Also to provide designated smoking areas so as not to annoy the majority who are non smokers. All said I have already rebooked for the new year and hope to see an even better Resort.;4;1;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Devaney88;Great hotel, good value;A very nice hotel in Legian and good value for money. We stayed in the room with a private plunge pool which was really handy if you only wanted a q ck cool down rather than go to either of the 2 main pools. We had lunch at the upstairs pool which was tapas style and very good and we found all staff and security very friendly and helpful. Main drawback is the very busy road the hotel is situated on as the noise can be a bit irritating, on the plus side it is close to lots of restaurants and shops and the beach is only a 10 minute walk away. We would stay here again no problem.;4;1;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;AKC A;Great Value for Money Hotel;I have stayed at many hotels in Bali, we had purchased a voucher via scoopon for this trip, it was an extremely good deal, we upgraded to the room with a plunge pool. I think people need to keep in mind when booking the Mercure it is more a Hotel, not a resort! They have two pools, not that many sun lounges, so in peak season if they were fully booked you would probably not be able to nab a lounge. On this occasion it was not a problem for us, when the pool was busy we just lounged by our plunge pool ( would suggest the hotel consider putting more outdoor furniture in the rooms though - we only had two big bean bag type lounges). The Plunge pool does not get full all day sun, just small parts of the outdoor area do. The rooms are spacious, the bed was amazing,;4;0;0;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Cozzy62;Great Location,great new hotel;We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. On the corner of a busy street but when you're inside it's a totally different place, a welcome calm greets you. So the location turns out to be an advantage but peace isn't compromised. Close to shopping, many restaurants & bars, a short walk to the beach to see the gorgeous sunsets. Inside the hotel it's so nice, the staff are all welcoming,from the security guards (we grew fond of Hisyam, extremely conscientious) to front desk staff, the kitchen staff are such a friendly bunch (particularly at breakfast,no request is too hard) and the housekeeping girls are very hard working keep the rooms very clean.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Jimfred49;Good staff let down by facilities;Stayed there for 5 nights not totally impressed the little things were missing EG no face washer, or paper covers for the glasses. We had a ground floor room which smelt musty because the wasn't a window to let in fresh air. Traffic noise was a problem and we couldn't see where to get drinks at the ground floor pool the hotel is not kid friendly as there is no grassed areas for them to play.Our friends had a balcony room but there wasn't any tables or chairs. The staff were absolutely fantastic. I personally prefer the older Mercure Sanur;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;bengeelong;Excellent value hotel;This is a very good busy hotel, great staff, but it is noisy on the road sides of the hotel. I requested a move and was moved to the back of the hotel which was perfect. So if you are a light sleeper make sure you confirm away from the roads at booking time. The rooms and bathroom were very clean. Breakfast was ok and the pools were clean. The staff were engaging and friendly and requests were always followed up. The hotel is a short 5 minute walk to the beach and there is plenty of shopping and good restaurants around. Traffic is chaotic in Bali but everyone knows this. If you don't want to use the hotels services, there is a laundry and money changer across the road and kwik mart down the street.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;amylous;Great start to Bali;This was our first trip to Bali so we wanted to start somewhere that eased us in...and the Mercure Legian was perfect. The staff were super friendly and so helpful. They called the safari park for us to organise our visit there, and answered any question we had. We got airport transfers which helped get to the hotel from the airport and breakfast daily which, although the same every day so got a bit boring, was delicious. We were in a balcony room facing the street on the top floor. It was clean and a perfect home base. At night you could hear the street noise, but for us by the second night it didn't bother us. It was a max 5min walk to the beach and along the way there were heaps of market stalls, places to eat and bars. The pools were always clean and our daily massages;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;housesounds;Value for money;Stayed at the Mercure Bali Legian for 12 nights early September at this fairly new property. Rooms were very good for the price except I found the bed a little hard. Breakfast was the usual fair. There was a generous selection of eggs, rice and noodles, as well as chicken, fish, vegies, salads, beans, potatoes, fr ts and everything else that you would want. Staff are very helpful and always asking after you. Check in and out was simple and q ck. The two pools were adequate. We had dinner at the hotel and it was well presented and tasty also at a good price. The beach is about ten minutes down Jl. Melasti, not too far. Many bars, restaurants and shops close by. All in all a clean moderately priced hotel with very good amenities, as well as dedicated staff.;4;0;1;1;1;0;0

Once door and curtains were closed for the night, it was surprisingly q et. The buffet breakfast was excellent. The adult pool area on the 4th floor was amazing!

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Andreea B;Amazing stay;The hotel is amazingly located, walking distance from the shops, bars, restaurant, beach. Very clean, the staff is super friendly, very good WiFi connection. For being a platinum member at Accor, I got upgarde to a bigger room with a huge terrace (around 25 sqm) - the only bad thing is that you could always hear the noise from the street from the traffic and the windows were not really well isolated. As improvement for the future, I would suggest to put more light in the rooms and more international variety at breakfast. I would choose this hotel any time again and the main reason would be the friendliness of the staff.;5;0;1;1;1;1;0

What really topped it off was the fact my son was sick one night late.

Having experienced both room I can say that either one is nice, well appointed and styled the same. The only difference is the sitting area space and balcony that you get with a deluxe, but if you're out and about in Bali then this won't bother you and there plenty of seating around the hotel and by the pools, and a slightly larger bathroom. (There is a curtain in the bathroom to block the panel of glass at the end of the shower, there is a small gap but our second room had some blurred tape down each side so it's an issue that is being addressed) Rooms have b lt in adapters to the power;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Ella ans Budiada were standouts and made us feel welcome and the stay more enjoyable. The hotel itself is nice and and well maintained with all extra services available at a reasonable price (60 min massage $25AUD and most mains $10-15 AUD). We stayed in a private pool room which was nice, a bit small but well priced. The only negatives we found were; when the shower is first turned on there is a strange smell, this q ckly passes and is not a big deal.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;syd_mike;Pleasant stay & atmosphere;Stayed here for the last 3 nights in Bali with partner. Found the hotel to be around for only less than 12 months. It was on special, about $85 per night for a room with a balcony. Breaky was satisfactory,a smorgasboard with plenty to chose from. This hotel has 2 swimming pools, kids generally use the pool on the ground floor and big kids use the protruding pool above the lobby. The first night we stayed on the 5th floor, the room had a connecting door. We asked for a balcony room but to our dismay, the balcony had no outdoor furniture at all. Around 9pm, the people in the next room checked in. They were very chatting, giggling and noisy. It lasted for about 45 mins.The noise came through the connecting door in the room. We complained 3 times and finally 2 security guards;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Diana L;Very comfortable rooms;We stayed here in March and then again in August. The few teething problems of a new hotel have been sorted out, and the Hotel is fully functioning. The two pools are sparkling clean. The rooftop pool overlooks Legian Street and is located off the Spa and has luxury deck lounges. Breakfast provides a huge variety of foods catering to all nationalities. The front desk staff are very friendly. My only complaint was I asked for a iron and ironing board which never came. The rooms are very comfortable, the bed was superb, linen lovely and clean. I would recommend this hotel. Also it is ideally situated in bustling Legian road within a short wlk to the beach and even closer to the shopping precinct and lots of markets and eateries.;4;0;1;1;1;0;1

The staff were all very friendly but the restaurant service was a bit slow. The food was good, even though the menu is q te limited. We had a corner room with a large balcony but there was no outdoor furniture so we had to drag the chairs from our room out there. There were not enough lounges or shade at either of the pool areas. The room was clean but there were no face washers in the bathroom and we had to request more soap and tissues. The reception desk was friendly and helpful but for some reason were unable to give us a receipt for our final bill when we checked out. Perhaps a little more decoration, eg plants, in the long corridors to give the place a bit more character.;4;1;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;KatePe;Perfect location and a few tweaks will make this an appealing hotel;After tossing up between this hotel and one nearby, we chose this hotel after we found a Scoupon deal which was really unbeatable on value ($1599 for 10 nights for interconnecting rooms, daily 1hr massages for 2, and 4 dinners or lunches each). The location was perfect: Legian shopping/restaurants at the doorstep, 5 min walk to the beach and short taxi ride to Seminyak (also walkable). It is a new hotel, so very clean and modern. We were told under our deal that the deluxe rooms were booked, therefore we would have to downgrade to superior rooms, which was fine by us. They were adequately sized (having 2 rooms connecting always makes it feel less claustrophobic anyway). They didn't have a balcony, so the rooms gave more of an inner city hotel vibe, rather than a resort, and in;4;1;1;0;0;1;0

Great to have a private dip after a hot day doing the markets or doing a tour. Possibly the most comfortable hotel bed ever! Typical Mercure fare with two main pools, and a decent morning buffet breakfast. Impeccable and helpful staff. Security is good. Not sure what the issue with lighting is in Bali - shops and hotels, including this one, are all so dark and in desperate need of a lighting designer. TV remote is almost impossible to use, even for my travel companion who has a TV installation business. Light switches also a bit complicated. Why a new hotel;4;0;1;1;0;0;1

Lovely staff which speak excellent English, well apart from the security guys on the driveway. We stayed in the King bed balcony room which is spacious, clean and modern. The balcony has to be seen to believed. Estimation of the balcony is about 3/4 of the room with a lovely outdoor settling for two. The only complaint with the room is you have to be a techno geek to work the TV remote (extremely hard to turn on or off TV) and no information booklet at either room or front deck area about facilities in or around the motel. There are two pools, one ground floor and one on forth floor. Ground floor is surrounded by the motel with beautiful large palms for shade. Forth floor pool (see first picture) is more;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;leethomo;Perfect location ...not so perfect in places.;My husband and I did enjoy our stay here at Mercure Legian. As Gold Accor members we booked using all of our accumulated points for our stay. Check in after a long and tiring late night flight was a disaster. No welcome as Accor members (not fussed over that) no welcome drink (would have made the long wait slightly more bearable) and very flustered staff when I asked about an Accor upgrade..which they happily provided. But...the very long wait and processing of everything was extreme. As very regular visitors to Bali we understand about being on Bali time....but It took over an hour to finally get to our room. We assumed there would be a stocked mini bar but this was empty and the last thing I wanted to do was trek to a store for drinks at 2am. On the plus side the plunge pool;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Kelly L;A Bali Beauty;We stayed here on an 8 day Webjet deal. The hotel is very new so all the facilities are clean and in great repair. Hotel offers 2 pools, 2 bars and a lovely restaurant. The breakfast was great with a wide range of choices from cereal and toast to made to order eggs or traditional Indonesian dishes. While the speciality lunch and dinner, included in the package, was very limited in choice and size, the food was very tasty. I must say it was what you would expect from a discounted holiday package. The range of cocktails available, also included in the package daily, was good and the cocktails very tasty. The free Wifi has great service in all areas of the hotel, including in your room. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The only negative was that we really couldn't always;5;0;0;1;0;1;0

We paid for a deluxe room but upgraded to a Junior s te at 200,000 rp per night. They actually only charged us for 8 nights, so that was great. Really appreciated that. The junior s te had a little sitting room on the side which gave a bit more room to spread out. Has all you need in the room, water daily, tea/coffee making facilities, in room safe. We had 2 TV's. Plenty of cupboard and wardrobe space. Spacious shower and bathroom. The only gripe I had in the room was the lighting, especially in the bedroom. There was no overhead light, only 2 very dim bedside lights, so very hard to read if that's what you would like to do. I like the flooring, timber look and light in colour. I think the;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;NatBr0wn;Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff;We had booked an 8 day package via webjet that the hotel was more than happy to keeping moving about at horribly short notice due to the ash cloud airport closures. Communication was excellent and apart from a missed pick up at the airport ( we got a taxi it was $12 and about 10 minutes) i am unable to complain about anything. Our original room was a s te but as it overlooked the incredibly busy main road intersection we were moved to a regular room somewhere a bit q eter. The on site spa was brilliant and i was 5 months pregnant and they knew what they could and couldn't do so i was able to enjoy a safe pamper. The pools were lovely, good turn over with the sun beds as they didn't allow people to hold them if they weren't there. Breakfast had lots of choice, the Friday BBQ;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;baj2300;Webjet Package;Webjet package makes this hotel attractive and affordable. Its a 4 star hotel which struggles to meet all expectations of the webjet package that's being marketed. The negatives Check-in desk seemed to be unusually slow. One chair per room, no balcony chairs. Limited lounge seating around the pool. Canyon like echoing of any noise from children playing in the pool. the pool shuts at 9PM Our Positives Attentive staff Daily massage great. Comfortable bed and good sized room with reliable wifi, television had BBC and 2 Fox sport channels. Central Breakfast buffet with many choices. Hot and strong shower.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Hilary M;Good value;Staff very friendly, location great but room service leaves a bit to be desired We had to chase towels ond day and no water or teabags left that day.

Then we came again last week with family (we love the pool) and the same problem occured. Our rooms were upgraded but one of the key card to one of the rooms didnt work. It took the hotel 2 days. So within those 2 days,we had to contact the reception desk to open our room when we came back to the hotel (using their master key). It was fine when the front desk is empty, unluckily the hotel were usually packed with tourist in buses. So...imagine the wait just to get into our own rooms Breakfast was good.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;DenandAli;Nice 4 star place;I have only stayed here because Jetstar delayed my flight and sent me here. While it is not the sort of place I would normally stay,I have found it very nice with friendly and helpful staff. They were inundated with tired and upset people all at once and very competently assigned us all rooms without too much fuss. The rooms are clean and nicely designed apart from the previously mentioned 'window' between the shower and the bed! Very strange and not necessary - suggest they cover them up if they want to attract those who are not on a romantic holiday! There are plenty of options for breakfast, so don't know why anyone would complain about it. Jetstar gave us all a set menu dinner which was also fine. I also had tapas lunch by the 4th floor pool which was delicious and good;4;0;0;1;1;0;0

We were 'stuck' in Bali due to the ash cloud from the volcanic eruption and Virgin Airlines bussed us (and many other passengers) to this hotel. We did not pay for our accommodation or food for the time we stayed here. And I have to say that if you are going to get stuck somewhere, Bali is the place to be stuck and this hotel is a lovely place to be stuck in! We were in a twin room on the 3rd floor. Overall it was a nice looking room and obviously fairly new. The only thing we didn't like was that there was a glass wall separating the bathroom from the bedroom but there was a blind you could pull down so you couldn't see in. It was a bit weird. Apart from that the bathroom was q te modern and stylish. Oh, the shower smelled;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Kongco;Another recommended international hotel in Legian;In my last family holiday in June I stayed here with my parent in-laws, we booked two rooms. As I traveled also with my 9 years old kid, I found out later I got a corner room which can get extra-bed (I was told that usual size of this type is not big enough for an extra bed). I informed them that I would check in early around 10.30, they noted but I did not expect to get my room early either, well, finally on the spot they did allow us to check-in early enough. I guess they were not really full that day. Good start :) Location wise, they are in Legian - not in the busy and noisy part of Legian though so you can expect a q et stay.

The staff were friendly and very efficient and nothing was too much trouble. The fitness room could benefit with one more cross trainer as some mornings we had to wait to use the machines. The pool area on the fourth floor was very relaxing and we usually spent a couple of hours here during the afternoon.

We got the standard 2 towels and 1 floor mat for our room each day. There should be the above in the bathroom and then 2 pool towels on a wall rack outside and a floor mat as you enter back into the room on the floor. A couple of times I caught the room service people and asked for separate towels for the pool and they happily said yes. But they would take them away the next day.

Staff are A1 and ever so attentive. Rooms are comfortable, cool and s table to our needs. Options are available so check if you want extras. Pool on 4th floor is great and gets lots of Sun. Walking distance to everything and transport is not far away either. Breakfast is Buffet style and has multi selections. Drinks at the downstairs bar are also A1. Pleasant stay and would visit again.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Cr sin57;Great Hotel;I will start with the 1 negative to this hotel which probably wouldn't bother most people, we would have liked and Australian netwrok channel to be listed among the 50 or so channels at this hotel - very few english channels and I understand not many people are into television but we are very sport orientated and like to kick back a couple of hours a day and relax. In saying that, this hotel is lovely, the interior decor is very tastefully done, the breakfast is well prepared and presented and great variety, something for everyone. There are 2 pools wiith plenty of seating etc, we booked a plunge pool room which is fantastic. The staff here are really lovely as you expect from the Balinese, nothing is too much trouble ranging from Reception to engineering to breakfast. It is;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Trek282126;pure bliss;Had a wonderful stay at Mercure Legian. Restaurant & bar staff excellent especially Ela, Agus & Bidiada. They know customer service & are exceptional staff. Other staff would benefit from spending time with these three people. They made us feel so special that we checked out of our last weeks accommodation a day early just to see them again. Would definitely come back again. All the restaurant staff are excellent & a credit to Mercure Legian. They also make the best flat white coffee in all of Bali. There was a few teething problems with the fourth floor pool. there is a dangerous step in the lobby where there is no delineation between levels that I missed & nearly fell, the tiles around the pool are really slippery so be careful when walking around the pool.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Titi S;Huge Balcony to relax;We were transferred to this hotel for 1 night by Mercure Kuta due to overbooked. The hotel is very new. Room & balcony is huge. We got a room on 2nd floor and the balcony is facing the hotel lobby. At times, while sitting at the balcony, the noise level can be extreme from the guests talking at the lobby. But once you shut the glass door, you won't hear the noise from the room. Breakfast spread is great. However, the staff is not that friendly or smiley except for the conceirge. Anyway, overall stay at this hotel is great. What's more important is the room, comfy bed & pillows!;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

Hotel is new and clean. Q et for those who do not want to be located near clubs, but it is of a walking distance. Very very good location. Mercure Legian has friendly and helpful staff. You will be greeted by the staff everywhere you go! We feel so welcomed! Tried the massage in the hotel in day 1 and we then do the massage again, almost everyday. Really would like to thank their spa staff, Pratini and Tari for the relaxing massage and also their friendliness. Overall, we difinitely enjoy our stay there and will come back again hopefully this August or September!! Heartfelt thanks to all the staff who attended to us, especially Restu,;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;cooliegirl71;Beautiful Place, Beautiful Staff;We booked this hotel for our honeymoon because it was new and the price was q te good. The hotel and the room we beautiful presented modern and clean. The staff were always polite and smiling. We had a buffet breakfast every morning (part of the package) and the selection of food was delicious and fresh. The rooms do need more draw space but we were staying 10 days which is rare. Great balconies. Both the pool were excellent with lattice style beds in the shallow end in the pool. Though it was not near the beach it was a short walk but most of the clean beach you need to get a taxi to anyway. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone can't fault it.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;shaye57;Perfect Place to Stay;I have just spent 6 days at the Mercure Legian and I have had a fantastic time. I was there just to relax for a few days, get away from it all, and this was the perfect place to do it. I stayed in a superior room which was more than comfortable, and can honestly say I have no complaints, everything was great.. The location of the Mercure is awesome, just seconds way from great restaurants and bars, a secure money changer just across the road and the beach is just a short stroll away. The staff at the Mercure are a credit to the hotel, they were the nicest people, always with a smile and a hello. They even surprised me with singing Happy Birthday and a beautiful cake on the morning of my Birthday, to which they had not been told of, and as I had not long lost my mother, I'm not;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;ash92;Good stay afterall.;We checked in for a 3 nights stay. We arrived late evening and was given far end room of the Hotel despite requesting for room closer to the lift. The Manager was helpful and later checked us to another room of our choice. Room was good with all facilities well maintained as I understand the Hotel is one of the newest. We were told that the walk to the beach was about 10 minutes but actually the distance is 20 minutes or more. Buffet breakfast served was good too. Apart from the Hotel, I could not see anything interesting surrounding it. Honestly, I would prefer to stay elsewhere on my next visit, recommended at Seminyak.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Pools were great and the room was very spaciouos and clean. Good location in the centre of Legian and Kuta and close to the beach. The only criticism I have is that there was no outdoor furniture on the verandah attached to our room. Such a lovely large verandah and no furniture to sit on and enjoy, what a waste.;4;0;1;1;1;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Mars C;Nice and Clean;I stayed there for business and had no big expectations. I stayed in a twin room and I think it had a great size. Enough room for the luggages and even had a sofa/lounge area. The room and bathroom are clean. The fridge didn't seem cold enough though and didn't have anything in it. Room make-up happens daily. The breakfast buffet had a lot of selections. But I think it's halal certified because no pork was served during my stay. There are two pools you can enjoy. Service was great too. They know how to answer your questions and do greet you with a smile. This hotel is actually huge. There's like an inception of rooms might take time to actually get to the lift. I guess depending on your room number. Recommended if you want something in Legian but in a q et section of it.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;martha p;SATISFYING STAY;"I and my husband stayed 2 nights. And we found that the hotel is clean and cozy although the interior is simple. The room is not spectacularly big, but at least there are ample space for us to walk in the room. The bathroom is clean, which is a plus to my opinion. The amenities is simple, though; there were only 1 tube of shampoo, 1 tube if shower gel and a piece of soap bar. The sanitary bag was provided only one piece per day (usually I found some other hotels provided 2 bags per day). However, staying in this hotel does worth the money as this hotel has huge open spots that we can use for relaxing, such as pool areas, front yard near the exit gates, etc. And additionaly, the location is strategic since it is near both Kuta and Legian areas. There are a lot of eateries";4;0;1;0;1;1;0

It has 2 pools, one at ground level, another one at 4th Floor (unfortunately at that time it was under maintenance so we couldn't use it). The staff is very helpful and friendly. When we checked in the bell boy was on meal break, the receptionist (who managed our checked in) helped us with our luggages to the room. very attentive and caring one...

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;119mariuszw;The price - quality balance that never dissapoints you;We stayed in the hotel in May 2015 having occupied 2 rooms. The hotel is brand new, in very good location, only 7 min to the Kuta beach, main shopping street is just around the corner, with money exchange, souvenir shops, restaurants. If you like walking, Carrefour in Kuta is still within your range - aprrox 2 km from the hotel. The rooms are modern, comfortable, with large bathroom. and cozy beds with new good quality linen. The small areas for improvement in th room are TV being not connected to a antenna signal, low battery in safe box deposit, bathrobe not avalable in our room.I believe tis is not the case of all rooms since my father's room included all those amenities. The quality of buffet breakfasts was really amazing - selection of hot dishes, egg station, sushi;4;0;1;0;0;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Cinder0511;Great central location;We stayed in April 2015 on an early bird opening special. The rooms were very clean and enough for our needs. We got 2 interconnecting rooms. The breakfast buffet was typical of bali hotels but with the added extra of a choice of coffees rather than the normal percolated style. Satellite tv in the rooms but not all channels were in English. Wifi was readily available but unsecured so my laptop wouldn't connect. The pools were lovely and a nice temperature with sunbeds half submerged in the pool. Gym was excellent and the massage centre was also very good and reasonably priced for a hotel spa service.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Stephen G;Great place for all;Just returned from staying 5 nights and would highly recommend. The staff are excellent and will do anything you ask with a smile. Pros: Very good breakfast, large bathroom, comfortable bed, 24hr room service and reasonably priced, both pools are great, especially the top one where there is more lounges in the sun, prime location and value for money. Cons: Fridge is useless. I read that in a lot of the reviews. It's the only major negative I can think of, so surprised this hasn't been fixed. - Constant construction noise from next door (not hotels fault and you get used to it. And I image that is the case with most hotels in Bali) - Twice the top pool was unavailable due to a private function (minor inconvenience, but if you paid for 2 pools we should be the priority) - The;4;1;0;1;0;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;MrChris69;Very impressive hotel;I stayed here with my Mother and my Aunty in two superior rooms overlooking the bottom pool. We stayed for 6 nights and it was a fabulous place to stay. We went for a lovely walk each morning to the beach (about 5 minutes away) then back for the delightful buffet breakfast. Shopping and excellent money changer right outside the gate. Restaurants abound around here. Took about 20 minutes to walk to Kuta Square and then back along the beach. 4th floor pool was lovely except not much shade through the day and the top step into the pool was very slippery, but I believe they were being fixed very soon. Staff were lovely and extremely helpful. Overall a lovely spot to base yourself in for your holiday in Bali. Will defiantly be staying again.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;ZachSimmie;Would stay again;Good place to stay with a great location right in the middle of legian so its very close to kuta and seminyak, plus its on the main street which makes transport very easy.

Having stayed in other Bali resorts with a strong desire to be outside of the Kuta region I was hesitant about changing however was pleasantly surprised. The welcome and check in was efficient, the room exceeded expectations with a comfortable bed and effective air-con, the other facilities were also great. Only 2 minor let downs for the stay - 1 being breakfast. I am yet to have a buffet breakfast in Indonesia where the hot items are anything more than mildly luke warm and unfortunately this Hotels fare was the same. Hence I visited the egg station and get a fresh omelette. The dinner I had in the same restaurant was faultless though. 2, the TV remote.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;chillseeker1956;New hotel with wonderful motivated staff (Apr. 2015);"Allocated a very nice room with a balcony that was the room size again, overlooking one of the two pools. A smaller balcony with larger room was on offer. Room looked onto a feature rain forest tree which wisdom saw the hotel retain. Common areas (pools, foyers & restaurant are excellent). Although in a noisy part of town, its central location makes up for that. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff in this new venture; they all seemed enthusiastic, professional with a perceived passion to make this venture work. Some of the hotel (room) fittings were not holding up to the job asked of them, so hopefully these issues will be addressed (balcony doors/locking mechanisms/some wall attachments). Overall, a great stay in a very busy, central location.";4;0;1;1;0;0;0

So our first day, we weren't allowed to leave the hotel, but they went above and beyond to look after us. We were allowed outside around the grounds and in the pools but only until 6pm. They had towel folding displays and fr t carving and plenty of board games. The buffet cost $12 and had a huge variety of Balinese food. All the guests had fun mixing in with each other and getting to know the staff. The staff are amazing and soooo attentive. They couldn't be friendlier if they tried! Even the security guards tell you to be careful on the streets and stay safe! Of course it can't be all perfect so the few issues we found were: 1.

Breakfast was great with both asian and western options. We were served buffet lunch and dinner, both meals were good although only Indonesian food were served at both times. A bit of variation would be great, imho. Room was clean and spacious. We didn't get the basic toiletries but explained after that we need to request them if we need them..it's the economy i guess.. The highlight of the stay was the rooftop pool. Great space. Just a note, there were kids in the gym playing on the treadmill, although they were under their parents supervision.

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Adrian N;Great staff and friendly service;Our family of six stayed for 7 nights and understanding that the hotel has recently opened, we did not expect perfection. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was well catered for the small amount of customers. I suspect the hotel was about at 30 to 40% capacity. The food was always fresh and the chef ensured no wastage. I was impressed with the standard of food and variety. Although there was some confusion about catering for six people in two rooms, the issue was corrected and the complete service from all the staff was extremely positive and friendly. The rooms were of good quality and very well catered for. There was minimal noise from the traffic or other hotel patrons, however, it was very q et.

They were extremely accommodating from the moment we walked in. We stayed on the fourth floor, which is where the gym, health spa and new pool which isn't yet opened. For the price it is you really get your money's worth. The rooms are designed really well and have a lot of space and lighting. The showers are amazing, the best I've had in bali actually! There is a safe, and empty fridge which is handy to put your own drinks in. The buffet breakfast changes daily but there is a lot of selection and you can get eggs and pancakes freshly cooked. The location is great! 10 min walk to either seminyak or Legian or a q t taxi ride. There's a money changing place across the road also;4;1;1;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Mmmatesss;Haven in the middle of Kuta/Legian;We stayed in this newly opened hotel for 4 days in February. The hotel is convenientaly located in Legian area, where the main street to Kuta starts. We did not enjoy the Kuta area atmosphere (bars and clubs), therefore the hotel was a very nice and q et haven. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We enjoyed very much the pool side, the spacious rooms and luxurious breakfasts. From the hotel we managed to see the island as we organized few trips from there (volcano, monkey forest in Ubud, etc.) Next time in this area I will definitely stay in Mercure Legian, it was really great stay.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

Our room was of good size & enough room for cases on the floor. The hot water does take some time to come through for the shower. Our room had NO opening windows or sliding doors to the pool, just pool view. This was a little disappointing. Although our rooms were a very short walk to the pool. The pool is great, and has pool beds in the water. The breakfast had a lot of variety on the buffet, also they cook eggs and pancakes on order.

Bathroom was large, plenty of amenities, Large shower room, lots of fluffy towels.

Staff were friendly, polite, and generally q ck to respond to my requests. The room was large and clean. Buffet breakfast is typical Mercure/Novotel standard. However, the shower water pressure and temperature was unstable, fluctuating between hot and cold. And what's with hotels not providing amenities like tootbrush and tooth paste which i would have thought was standard for the Mercure/Novotel brand? Overall, a good experience and pleasent stay. Would certainly visit again.;4;0;1;1;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Johneevegas;Value for money.;"I stayed here with friends for 5 nights in February. First impressions are great. A well designed foyer that would fit well in a higher standard hotel. I understand that it is a ""soft"" opening of this new complex so I cant be too critical of some aspects of the hotel. The positives: The price was around 50% of what I would expect to pay for a hotel of this quality. The food at the restaurant was exceptional...yes I could pay a bit less on the street but the quality could never match. Breakfast was brilliant. (The poached eggs were perfect but the egg station will need to be ramped up when it gets busy) Staff were very friendly but in my opinion, in some cases, as new as the hotel,,,,they of course will only improve with experience. Rooms are what I would expect from a Mercure";4;1;0;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;SRReviewer;Fabulous - will stay again!;We stayed at the mercure legian for 7 nights in January. We were aware that it was a new hotel so we were prepared for the cons this may bring. But the prices were cheap so we thought we'd give it a go. To our surprise for a new hotel we had far more pros outweighing the cons! We liked the rooms (look bigger on the website) but were still a good size! We loved the buffet breakfast where we met VERY lovely staff members (in particular Obi was VERY helpful and provided great customer service! Showing us indonesian fr ts we had not tasted and ensuring everything was okay with meals, asking for tea/coffee. He definitely was a highlight of our trip! Definitely needs to be rewarded for all he does!) WIFI was fabulous, so q ck! Unlike a previous review we prepared for no travel;4;1;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Donna F;NewMercure legian;My family of 2 adults and 2 teens have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Mercure Legian. We booked through Agoda and got early bird rates under 100 dollars for 2 interconnecting rooms on the fourth floor. We arrived from at the hotel at 11 a.m. and understandably our rooms were not available until 2 p.m., so we left our bags and went off for a coffee and walk. When we returned at 3 p.m. we were sent up to two rooms which were not interconnecting as requested, so back down to reception who said they only had one room available at the time and we would have to wait until the other interconnecting one was made up.{ they had known we wanted this from our Dec. booking and was confirmed when we arrived early.] The rooms were spacious, and well decorated .One was a king bed;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;Merccure Bali Legian;Raj Saiya;Good for the price. Needs little more work;The hotel rooms were a bit small but we were upgraded to a balcony room as it was our honeymoon. Staff needs a little more training as after the cleanup there was no cutlery in the room and had to call for it. Staff was attentive and responded q ckly. Bathroom was clean. May get better once fully open. The restaurant was nice with decently priced meals (we could have only vegetarian pizza as we have only veg) but good pizza. Drinks also well priced. Location is very convenient 5 mins from beach and lots of shops and cafes and restaurants around. Money changer opposite the hotel was one of the biggest and best in area. All around experience was good. The only issue may be the bed as it seemed like a Queen bed so tall people (5.8 and above) might not like it.;4;0;1;1;0;1;0

But, we decided, as it is very new, that we would treat ourselves to a massage and dinner there. Our first surprise was when we called in the day before to make reservations. We were informed that any guests dining at the hotel are welcome to use the pools for free. This is not common in Bali as so many places have a minimum spend to gain use of the pool. So, as we had viewed the delightful pool shaded with a beautiful Ancak tree right beside the restaurant, we decided to take advantage of the kind offer. We arrived for our massage at the spa on the 4th floor and were greeted in a very friendly manner. Taken to the massage room for couples and given robes, slippers and disposable pants to wear.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Suntanner71;Outstanding service, beautiful resort in quiet beachside location;We were lucky enough to stay at Ramayana Candi Dasa for 12 nights and this hotel was perfect for us. It is situated off the Main Street in Candi Dasa (which ensures a quiet position). The beachfront position provides a magnificent view of the ocean (with a great swimming pool) and looks out to Nusa Penida. I never tired of the ocean view or lovely sea breeze. We had a family room which was effectively a 2 bedroom apartment with kitchenette (including microwave and full size fridge). The bathroom was spacious and had a walk in shower. Daily housekeeping service was great and provided complimentary bottled water. The family room included a huge master bedroom (king bed plus a couch) and an adjoining bedroom with kitchenette, lounge and dining space. We also had a terrace;5;0;0;0;1;0;1
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;AnneKirchler;A wonderful place to relax and get away;As soon as you arrive you are met by warm and friendly staff, who cannot do enough to ensure you have a wonderful stay. Had a beautiful cottage with ocean views, spent many an afternoon sitting on the verandah enjoying the afternoon sea breeze. Enjoyed tasty meals, cocktails from Garpu restaurant... we enjoyed the cooking class experience, went to local markets to purchase produce required for our meal, it was a wonderful experience and enjoyed our Indonesian meal. From Candidasa you are able to get transport to The Kings Palace, White Sand Beach and The Water Palace. We will definitely be back...;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Grace G;Beautiful;This is the second time staying atRamayana Candidassa, and was just as enjoyable. They have worked hard in getting it up and running again. The room was very comfortable with an amazing bed. Modern bathroom and with hairdryer and walk-in shower. The gardens are well maintained as well as the pool which overlooks the ocean. The restaurant has a good buffet breakfast, mix of Indonesian and western. The menu for lunch and dinner was limited but in time I think it will improve. We had the opportunity to meet the new manager who had just taken his position there in August and is doing a great job making sure his guests are well looked after. The staff in every area of the complex are very friendly and willing to help. Do yourself a favour and get out of the hustle and bustle;5;0;0;1;1;0;1

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;pauldoris6562;Lovely peaceful resort with lovely peaceful staff;Moved here as a 'walk-in' after previous hotel wasn't what I wanted. The manager, Putu Surisman, went out of his way and spent so much time showing the different types of room. I then visited 2 other hotel options, but decided on Ramayana because of the anbiance and felt an immediate connection. I stayed 10 days and enjoyed every minute, and although the hotel was relatively well occupied, it never felt crowded. All the staff were so friendly and accomdating it was hard to leave. Ariawan, Sutini and Sinta all showed me much kindness. Only slightly negative point: the menu never changed... but there were enough local places to compensate.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;mrcrdeacon;Solid three star plus but room for improvement at breakfast;Set in a more remote part of the island but still with sufficient options to eat and drink nearby, the Ramayana is a solid three star hotel with some four star potential. The room was comfortable and I slept incredibly well over our three nights there. Good shower but amenities a little basic. The gardens, pool and its surrounds are pretty stunning. I enjoyed using the lovely warm pool. Very relaxing place. Staff absolutely lovely and service was attentive and they really could not do enough. Slightly let down by the quality of the breakfast - I’ve had better in a hostel. One morning the fruit tasted of onion as chef clearly hadn’t cleaned his knife. It was inedible. Extra points for the lovely and committed staff.;4;0;0;1;1;0;1
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Eddy;Nice place to avoid the crowds in Bali;Takes about 1 hour ride from Airport to reach the hotel.

Be cautious with rough waves and children.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;pmkiwiboy;Burst the Bubble!;A short Covid staycation out of our Canggu bubble for our 20th wedding anniversary and it did not disappoint. This is a lovely resort getaway to the peacefulness of East Bali. For those staff we met, they were all amazing and very grateful to be back at work during these tough times and eager to help and serve. We had a couples spa treatment which was very lovely. The resort organised a private table on the beach for an anniversary dinner and the meal and ambience was very enjoyable. The beachfront pool area is lovely and sunny and a great place to chill, relax and sunbake. There is no actual beach in front of the hotel, but you can take a short stroll to a small beach next to the hotel, at low tide and that is a lovely spot too. We love this resort and its ambience. Could it do;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;doctorjan714;One of the top resorts in the world I have EVER visited in my life!!!!;I’ve read that the Burj Al-Arab in Dubai, UAE is the “world’s only seven star hotel/resort.” I don’t know about that as I’ve never been there. But what I CAN tell you is that Ramayana Candidasa in Bali is the worthy of being called the only candidate for “six star resort” in which I’ve ever stayed. When we first arrived there, on Saturday afternoon, I was a little concerned when the driver took us down what was basically a goat path barely wide enough for the car we were in (although later in the week I saw a full-sized, high-roofed tour bus show up there). However, when he turned into the reception loop, I was left breathless. The staff assembled at the top of the stairs/ramp to greet us with smiles that only waned the day that we left two weeks later. I have never, ever met;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Melanie;Beautiful resort;We loved our stay here. It's a beautiful resort, down a quiet alleyway, right on the waterfront. The grounds, gardens and pool are impeccably neat and tidy and all the staff seem to have such pride in the resort. It really has a lovely feel to it. Our stay was during the low-season, and we were delighted to be upgraded from a hotel-style room to a bungalow. The bungalow was very comfortable, nice big bathroom, cool, quiet airconditioning and big patio out the front for enjoying a quiet drink surrounded by lovely gardens and water features. We spent a lot of time at the restaurant (Garpu restaurant) and just loved it there. It's situated right over the water and enjoying a cocktail and listening to the waves crashing below us was a real highlight! The staff in the restaurant;5;0;0;1;1;0;1

If you’re looking for a relaxing sea front holiday and plan to relax by the pool then this resort is ideal. There are plenty of sun beds with umbrellas available. The restaurant was an extremely pleasant experience. The food was good, varied and reasonably priced, and as throughout the hotel, the service truly exceptional. Rooms were modern, clean and had all the mod cons. No complaints whatsoever. It was about a 15 minute walk into the main part of Candidasa to get to the restaurants and bars which was no problem during the day but not so pleasant in the evening.

Everything just seems to be working like clockwork with staff and the student interns all providing the highest quality experience. Will definitely be coming back.

One staff, Ayu, was especially sweet and consistently helped me to learn a few new Balinese words and I appreciated how much she remembered me from day to day, thank young Ayu! The rooms were also quiet comfortable, although we wished our room had bathrobes and that the pillows were softer and thinner.

The result was a perfect week-long stay at this marvellous resort, and we look forward to returning there whenever we can.

We touched down at night and it took almost 2 1/2 hours to reach the hotel due to the distance from the airport. When we arrived, we had to go through a dark narrow alley to reach the hotel. Everyone was quite skeptical then thinking that I have booked a dingy hotel. How were we in for a surprise when suddenly we were welcomed by an immaculate imposing lobby. The check-in was smooth and we truly appreciated the invigorating welcome drink despite arriving quite late. The rooms I must say were not too spacious but comfortable for max of 2 adults and 1 child. The air-conditioner worked well. The bathroom was good but had no bathtub.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;HuwLawford;Outstanding;My wife and I stayed here for a week en route from London to Sydney. We wanted a relaxing time after a very busy couple of months. We hit the jackpot. The complex is a little oasis with very comfortable rooms. It is spotlessly clean and kept by charming staff who could not be more helpful. We signed up for the dinner and breakfast package, which we would recommend. The food is delicious with a wide-ranging menu. The pool is spotless. All in all an ideal place to just chill. A quite outstanding week, thank you.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;moman77;3 night stay;An excellent hotel with great service. Check in was done very quickly and we were given a complementary upgrade. A good size swimming pool with plenty of sun lounges. Breakfast was ok. The restaurant where breakfast was served was next to the beach and was nice to eat while watching and hearing the waves. The staff really go out of their way for you. One night we wanted to go out for dinner and one of the staff recommended a restaurant, made a booking and arranged for the restaurant to pick us up and drop us back to hotel. If I come again I won’t hesitate to stay here.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Raynor;Gorgeous hotel with the friendliest staff;We spent the first week of our honeymoon at Ramayana Candidasa and don't regret it at all. Our hotel room was always clean and restocked, the restaurant had great food and drinks and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to accommodate us and help us book various trips and activities around the island. They also made effort to learn our names and greet us daily. We felt extremely welcome. The hotel is located in a pleasant village with many restaurants and shops within walking distance. We always felt safe walking around there - even at night. The hotel and grounds are very well looked after and it felt like we were walking into an oasis of tranquility after a long day sight-seeing on the busy island. There are a few nice beaches a short;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

The staff are all super friendly and couldn’t do enough to help with anything we needed. The day starts well with breakfast overlooking the sea and continues until sundown with cocktails listening to the sea. Upon check in Sutini went out of her way to find us a room which we were happy with. Anik also made our stay memorable with lots of recommendations for things to do and restaurants for dinner. We were so happy with this resort that we rebooked before we left. Something we have never done before.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;JohnT;A beautiful and peaceful resort with amazing staff.;A wonderful two weeks in East Bali staying at the Ramayana Candidasa Resort. We booked through RCI but purchased a room upgrade to a deluxe cottage with ocean view which was amazing and well worth the few extra dollars. The Garpu restaurant's food was wonderful and menu selection was very good. The prices were comparable if not better than the local restaurants in Candidasa. So much so that we decided to purchase the breakfast and dinner package which was very good value. The staff were so friendly and attentive to all our needs that this was very much a highlight of our stay here. In particular, a very big thank you to Sinta & Suwela in the hotel lobby for the outstanding service and going out of their way to assist us with all our needs. Also a special thank you to Uni,;5;1;0;1;0;0;0

They have bent over backwards making our stay the most pleasant stay of our lives! We do not want to go back home. From excellent service, hospitality and great food we want to come here every year! This is truly a piece of paradise in every shape and form! We purchased the breakfast package but doing intermittent fasting for a year, it was difficult to eat before 10am. They gave me the opportunity to dish up for breakfast and reheat my food later the day which made up for my dietary requirements and made my stay so much more pleasant. The breakfast package is devine and truly is value for money!! And don’t forget the delicious free-flowing sundowners from;5;1;0;1;0;0;0

The only down-side are the noisy air-con in our room and a bit pricey charges at its Garpul restaurant / Spa saloon.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Very quiet and no real access to the beach but don't let that detract from the fact that it's a fantastic place to stay. Our accommodation was a garden villa but was upgraded to a poolside one and was great. Yoga was included on some mornings and the Yoga teacher Kawi was excellent. I'm very much a beginner but my other half has been doing yoga for years and she was particularly impressed with how good Kawi was. I'm a keen scuba diver so to have a five star PADI diving centre next door to the hotel was a bonus. I had four dives with Zen Diving and was very impressed. The equipment was a good standard and the Dive Masters excellent. Saw lots on the dives;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Sarah;Beautiful Beachfront Hotel;We stayed at the Ramayana last week and absolutely loved it. The gardens were incredibly well kept and tranquil, the staff were very nice (as they normally are in Bali), and the oceanfront pool was outstanding. The only (slight) let down for us was the breakfast. It was a 'partial' buffet, which means that you order something off the menu and you have a limited choice of buffet food. This may be fine for most but we didn't particularly like the concept and ended up eating at the Watergarden Restuarant every morning. Candidasa itself is lovely but does not have a lot of choice of shops or restaurants. Overall, a great experience and we will be returning.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

The views from it were also great of a hill. The swimming pool was also quite nice which was in front of the sea. The grounds were very nice in this hotel and were very pretty with little moats at the entrances of each building. The food was great Anne was also excellent service. The breakfasts were also very nice and had a great selection. The juices though weren’t too good after testing most of them. As this is one of the only hotels in this area I would definitely recommend it, but I would anyway. It’s a very pretty;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

The staff are another bonus to this wonderful resort, they really went out of their way to make me feel super special. A shout out to Resort Manager Ni Komang Sudewi.

There was a small plumbing issue but on reporting it they got on to it straight away. The pool is very good, great temperature and you can sit and watch out across the ocean. The restaurant is nice with a reasonable breaky and meals for lunch and dinner. We ate there a number of times throughout our stay for convenience and the lovely setting. They do a really good pineapple juice! My husband and I also had an excellent massage in the resort spa. I highly recommend it. It was my favourite massage on my 3 week holiday in Bali.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

I was welcomed by email before I arrived, airport transfer arranged and waiting, and staff ready to greet me even though I arrived past midnight. The rooms and all facilities were spotlessly clean and well furnished.

The facilities have been upgraded and maintained very well. Nice breakfast and many sweet places sitting around to read book. Amazingly, the reception staff Sulawe remembered me when I arrived late at night and even the lady boss of restaurant outside the hotel recognized me too.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;449mike;Rama Heavan - you will not want to leave;Sandwiched between sea & jungle, but only 80 mins from Bali airport, this resort is truly exceptional. Rooms are comfortable & grounds spacious & well planned. There is a great gym & spa, whilst the restaurant serves up super food & cocktails at very reasonable prices (although expensive relative to other Balinese restaurants). Staff are super friendly & courteous, but what really makes this special is the attention to detail & those small thoughtful things that just add extra value such as a cold towel & refreshing drink on your return from a guided walk. Plenty of free activities on offer, such as yoga & a very nice pool.;5;1;1;1;1;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;SunlitGypsy;What more could you ask for?;Everything is perfect about this resort without the luxury price tag.

The breakfast package was fabulous and the food was awesome, some great changes in tastes and the cocktail Sunday promotions were incredible allowing you to talk to the host manager Mr Richard who gave advice and also listen to any constructive feedback a true gentleman.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;XM5;Pure relaxation;Stayed in a Deluxe Cottage Ocean View for 2 nights with my wife. Normally we would have stayed at another hotel in Candidasa but since that wasn’t ready yet we stayed in this hotel instead. It was one of the best things that happened to us during our trip in Indonesia. At arrival we received an upgrade to a Deluxe Cottage Ocean View and one hour of Balinese massage for free. The room had plenty of space but was maybe a little outdated. The bathroom on the other hand seemed much more modern with a very spacious shower. Breakfast was delicious and a combination of a la carte and buffet. Dinner was a la carte and also delicious. The restaurant was a little crowded, that’s probably why it took a little longer to get our meals. The pool had some comfortable beanbags in which you can;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Our first room wasn’t great, not much natural light and had a very mouldy/damp smell but they happily moved us to an upstairs room which was perfect for our family of four. Rooms are spacious and clean. Yes, it’s an older resort but they maintain it well. The gardens are a highlight. Pool was beautiful and clean. Loved the sun lounges with clean covers and lazing about with the ocean breeze. If you don’t want to, there’s no need to leave the resort with a wonderful restaurant onsite.

All staff especially Sara were very attentive, friendly and efficient . LOVED the floating bean bags in the pool and the swinging day beds . It’s true that all the staff at the resort would greet you by name .

The room was clean, spacious and bed was very comfortable. On our first visit to the pool side, we were welcomed by Richard Balderson, Host Manager, and he informed us about the Sunset Cocktails - free flowing cocktails from 5-7pm every Sunday. He also told us about the area and the various places to visit nearby.

The resort is excellent: beautiful gardens, excellent service, very well equipped gym, very nice pool, great food and spa. The hotel offers free yoga several times a week and these sessions were great.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Murray Gill;The best of Bali;My 11 year old daughter and I had a wonderful stay at Rama Candidasa. We loved the immaculate tropical gardens, the swinging day beds looking out over the ocean and the excellent pool. Our room was beautiful and kept spotless by the housekeeping staff. There aren't many places to eat within a short walking distance, so we were glad that the restaurant had a great menu and was surprisingly well priced for the quality of food and location. We had many meals there, breakfast, lunch and dinner and thoroughly enjoyed them all. The restaurant staff were attentive and knowledgable and a pleasure to interact with. The internet worked consistently and well, far better than some we have experienced in much more expensive hotels in Bali. To me the most important thing about a hotel, and;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

We were greeted with a refreshing drink and were made to feel very welcome by all the staff upon arrival. The grounds of the hotel are so pretty, in traditional baliense style, it's so lovely that we enjoyed just wandering around the grounds! The pool area is beautiful with different areas you can sit, the cocktails are pretty good too and the free afternoon tea around the pool is another great feature. Breakfast was the star of the show and with an excellent cup of coffee to top it all off. My sister and I had the Balinese Heritage massage and it was 90 minutes of indulgence - highly recommend. The hotel has a very nice traditional feel which we particularly liked;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

They offered us a refreshing ginger tea and greeted us so well. The best part was the relaxing foot massage. They allotted us a wonderful room with a garden view 303. The room was a bit small but it was cosy and had nice antique touch. I was highly impressed with there service. They were always a call away and always ready to help. The breakfast was very lavish.

I cannot stress enough how kind, attentive and warm the staff were – calling us by our names at every possibility and wanting to organise lovely day trips around the local area for us. Our room, one of the little huts that almost faced the pool/ beach, was immaculate and very clean.

Some of the areas are a tad run down but don't fault it for that cause the staff and surroundings are truly wonderful. Our room was upgraded and we were welcomed with an anniversary cake and greeting on our bed as we are celebrating our 10th Wedding Anniversary and the staff were truly kind.

Overlooking the sea, lovely loungers and swinging seats etc. Afternoon tea with free coffee/tea and cakes round the pool. The restaurant is a delight, overlooking the beach and sea. In terms of location about 20 minute walk to main village but there is a free shuttle. Plenty of restaurants there. Wouldn't walk back in dark as pavements and roads a bit dodgy but the cabs are cheap. We got the romantic massage package and worth every penny. Would we stay here again..yes please!;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

We ended up staying at the Rama (now called Ramayana) for four nights and I wish it were longer. The resort grounds were absolutely stunning and the pool temperature was perfect. The staff were amazing and really took the time to get to know everyone's names. We stayed in a family room which was massive, the only negative with the room is that the lighting on the wall behind the bed in the master was a little dodgy but honestly this didn't have any real impact on our stay. There is a shuttle into town every morning which we used once. It leaves Rama at 10 and returns at 12.

Everyone in the lobby everyday knew our names and checked regularly that we were happy and if we were in need of anything. It was really nice not to be just a number for a change. When I got sick there was nothing the staff wouldn’t do to make sure I was comfortable. The food @ Garpu was great, I’ve never in my many visits to Bali had the freshest spring rolls ever than I had @ Garpu. I loved the afternoon tea set up by the stunning Oceanside pool.

Even has own kitchen area within the room. Pool is very impressive and plenty of sun beds. Restaurant is lovely and menu is good. Staff friendly and helpful.

On entering the magnificent lobby we were informed of everything we needed in a timely and friendly manner by the gentleman (Ariawan) checking us in and also given an upgrade on our room. As we were very early arriving our room wasn’t quite ready so we enjoyed lunch at the Garpu restaurant on site which was very good. The manager then came to inform us that our room was ready and took us to the suite. It was very clean and to a higher specification than any of the rooms we had enjoyed so far. We had already visited a lot of sites in Bali so decided for our last 5 days just to relax and there;5;0;0;1;0;1;0

We’d recommend both the spa massages (superb!) and the free yoga sessions (currently two per week). The staff are so welcoming and we had fantastic service from the restaurant/bar. Great location. Local restaurants will come and pick you up (and take you back) and we’d recommend Vincent’s especially on a Thursday with live jazz.

We were picked up by the restaurants staff and brought home to! Made was our local taxi driver who collected us and took us around local areas and then onto ubud, he was a delight and very friendly. The pool is perfect and we honestly cannot fault anything. Spa is recommended to, we had a 60 min massage at discount rate and this was perfect!

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Gavin B;Lovely beach resort;Stayed here at the tail end of our first Bali stay, the buildings and facilities are a trifle tired, but the number of staff working every day to maintain and improve what's here definitely shows. We were upgraded to a balcony suite free of charge on arrival, with a lovely soft bed and a huge terrace overlooking the sea. No baths in the bathroom or robes in the rooms if that's a deal breaker for you, but the zen garden and pool area are both just immaculate. Naff gym, as ever, but enough to keep yourself in the habit at least. Also a mecca for multiple large groups of French guests for reasons we weren't able to translate! So take that as you will.;4;0;0;1;0;0;1

It is impossible not to relax when staying here. The restaurant is expensive for Bali (on par for North America/Europe) but it is located right on the ocean which is worth it. The breakfast includes a buffet and the ability to order from a menu - really nice options like crepes suzette. The front desk helped us with booking a scooter for sightseeing, ferry tickets to Lembongan, etc. We won't even think of staying anyplace else if we return to this part of Bali.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

We kept in touch with the resort after our stay and their customer service was perfect and very prompt responses. I look forward to our next trip and staying here again!;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;JNScubaTravel;Excellent;We stayed at 3 hotels in Bali and this was by far the best. Everything from the checking in process to the restaurant was great. The spa services were fantastic and the views were amazing. Very responsive hotel staff. I had to call at night because I could not figure out how to shut the lights off, and they sent someone over right away. The rooms were very clean and modern. They catered to a high end experience.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;blackberrymaster;Mesmerizing & Beautiful Serenity Stay;This is my first Bali trip to Rama Candidasa (now change to Rama Yana) and it wont be my last. I'll try to point out this resort is suitable for whom when booking here. If you are retired or senior citizens, you most probably will love this place coz of their scenery. if you are a couple looking for quiet time, you probably will like this place as it will give you what you need. If you are single adventurer travelor, this place is not suitable unless you are seeking rejuvenating resting. If you are traveling with young kids, the pool with bean bags will occupy their time and become favourite. Our journey to Rama from Airport took 1 Hour 40 mins, ignore what you seen from google maps which saying only 60 minutes or less. It was far to say as we traveling with 2 young;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;teamseattle4511;Paradise and Away from the Maddening Crowds;We stayed 7 nights here after 7 nights earlier at their Rama Beach Resort in Kuta which was exceptional. Candidasa is about 90 minutes by car from Denpasar airport. It is away from the major population areas but still has plenty of local retail for dining, shopping and exploring. The hotel has the textbook feel of a tropical paradise - breezy open lobby and dining room pavilions, babbling waterfalls into peaceful ponds, waterfront views for hours of dreaming, and a staff that will pamper you every minute of your stay. The resort has several wings with rooms of different sizes to meet the needs of couples,singles or families. I upgraded to a waterfront villa which was worth every penny. I had a million dollar view from my ground level terrace. All the rooms were spacious, well;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Sue K;My 3rd stay at this beautiful resort;When I come to Bali I love to get away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta and Seminyak so jump in a car and go 1 1/2 hours away to beautiful Candidasa. See the real Bali, watch the locals harvest the rice paddies, swim in beautiful beaches, walk in the mountains and try the local cafe's and beaches. The staff at Rama Candidasa are just beautful. You are greated by friendly faces when you arrive and checked in seamlessly by professional staff. From the gorgeous pool boys, to the friendly waiters and waitresses at the restuarant and the amazing chefs, the food is 5 star. I never tire of visiting here. The rooms and gardens are spotless. Every afternoon there is free afternoon tea accompanied by a piece a cake. I cannot wait for my next visit. Thank you all at Rama;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Jess Ravalo;My feedback of Rama @ Candidasa;RamaCandidasa is an ideal hotel for those who want relaxation and privacy. We enjoyed our one-week stay and the facilities and staff can be ranked 5-star. My only drawback is the preparedness of the Hotel for medical emergency. My husband fell in one of those pathways with rocks and pool. They hotel could hardly come up with the right medical equipment or medicines. They hardly have a First Aid kit on standby. I wonder if the staff is trained for emergency, e.g., medical, fire, security, earthquake, etc. They have however a procedure for tsunami.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;LLogie;Excellent hotel with fabulous staff;"We stayed here for 6 nights-2 couples. We each had lovely garden view villas which were clean and comfortable. The shower was excellent. We had come here to relax after having been in Singapore and Ubud; we certainly managed that. The pool area was a lovely place to relax and enjoy the sunshine. All staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful. The food in the restaurant was excellent for breakfast, lunch and dinner; slight drawback was that they are doing a little work on the restaurant; this however did not detract from our stay in any way. Candidasa itself was very quiet with most bars and restaurants closing about 10pm, we did have a few good meals out and all restaurants run you back to the hotel free of charge. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to";5;0;0;0;1;1;1

Our room was comfortable and had everything we needed including a mini fridge and good air conditioning. The staff were all very friendly. Good food throughout our stay. The breakfast is al la carte for eggs, pancakes etc and buffet for the toast, cakes, cereal etc. Complimentary afternoon tea with cake is served by the pool between 3-4pm. We ate here every night and thought it was reasonable. It would be good if the spa treatment and excursion prices were in the room. You have to go to the spa or ask at reception for this. We would love to stay at this hotel again. Thank you Rama!;5;0;0;1;1;0;1
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;christopher n;Who needs a beach?;This is a beach resort without a beach (there is a hidden tiny one 2mins from hotel) instead you have lovely views from a sea wall and a constant breeze blowing through the perfect gardens. If you want sand between your toes there is a promenade atop the sea wall, about 10M wide, with swing beds and loungers. Behind this front is a lawn to one side and the pool and restaurant to the other. There is a shallow pool within the main pool. The rooms or cottages have garden views with only 4 or 5 with direct sea views, our room had a side view. The rooms at the back of the resort are in the most lovely garden. Everywhere there are fish pools and fountains and are all beautifully maintained. Parents might find this a disadvantage to a restful holiday for others it adds to the overall;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

The resort is ideally located for exploring the island, and is immaculately presented. The cottage we had was perfect, good size, modern, and very clean. The gardens, pool area and gym are excellent, with attentive staff keen to make your stay perfect. The resort also offers use of bicycles to visit the nearby town. It was our anniversary during our stay and the staff created something special within our cottage as well as making us a cake, which was a lovely gesture. The restaurant provides excellent food although a little more expensive than other places outside of the resort. Special mention to staff members Uni and Ganti who went above and beyond to make our stay special. Hopefully we will;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Trevor B;Lovely resort for relaxing holiday;This was the third resort we stayed at on our tour of Bali . Unfortunately our room did not have a sea view which our previous resort had but the studio room was spacious and clean but so dark . There were plenty of lamps but not bright enough bulbs and thick orange lampshades didn't help. That was the only negative as everything else was perfect . The food was excellent with plenty of choice and the location of the dining room meant I was able to watch the large ships moored opposite whilst enjoying my food. The staff couldn't be more helpful and friendly and I would have no hesitation in recommending this resort to anyone wanting a relaxing holiday . One big plus is that the site is flat unlike one of the earlier resorts we stayed at and therefore ideal for anyone with;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Sarah E;Quiet, peaceful & friendly staff!;My boyfriend and I stayed here for 7 days with the RCI part of the resort. As others have stated, the RCI part is at the back end of the resort but it’s seriously a 1 min walk to the pool, reception and restaurant. Yes, it would have been nice to have an ocean view but for us it wasn’t an issue as a room is a bed for when we want to rest when we travel! And speaking of beds, our bed (room 314) was humongous and very comfortable!! The room itself was tastefully decorated and comfortable. The only thing that could be tweaked was that the hot water took about 5 mins to come in and the kettle took about 10 mins to boil. Not an issue though, as for us, it’s part and parcel of Asia and its uniqueness!! Restaurant food was pretty good but the staff were so friendly and welcoming! We;4;0;1;0;0;0;1

Unfortunately the only set back is maintenance was required on facilities throughout the stay but the hotel were very quick to address these and also compensated us for any impact. The resort is part of the Timeshare trading schemes (RCI & DAE) which attracted us 1st but we also paid for a second double room to accommodate the 5 Adults traveling. The Family rooms are very enormous in size and very well priced. We would definitely recommend it and will stay here again when in Bali.;4;0;0;1;1;0;0

Very good location also (south east of the island) for starting most interesting visits on Bali.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Ken N;Stunning property on the beach.;We spent three nights in the Rama Candidasa. We found the rooms spacious, clean and modern, but they were out shined by the beautifully landscaped hotel property. On the beach, the restaurant, pool and grounds were outstanding. Flowers everywhere, a restaurant that extended over the ocean with waves sending spray above window height, a large pool and deck and attention to detail everywhere. Stunning! Service was excellent from the front desk to the restaurant. Meals were delicious and staff very concerned that your experience was the best. We would stay here again and recommend this hotel to all travelers going to Candidasa.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Curious758980;Stay at the Rama Candidasa, Bali;Stay at the sea view rooms or at the minimum cottages close to the sea. Breakfast is great in all respects. Continental cuisine is above average while the local Balinese cuisine is average. Service is excellent. Evenings by the ocean with the setting sun are breathtaking and sipping a glass of wine or beer into dusk an extremely soothing experience.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;777jess;Excellent resort;We spent three nights here out of our two week tour of Bali and loved it. The villa was beautiful, albeit small, but had all we needed and it was very central for the pool, reception and restaurant. We found the staff very welcoming and made sure they knew our names and worked hard to ensure we were comfortable. They arranged an excellent local tour for us and one morning we joined other guests for a walk with one of the staff who showed us the local paddy fields and surrounding areas. We really enjoyed our stay and would thoroughly recommend the resort.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Chris S;Awesome place;We didn't stay at this hotel but at one of the sister hotels in Legian, however we did spend a day here, where we were showed around the grounds and at a few of the room options.

We have booked here for next year.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Jaz8212;Great break in a great place;We recently spent a few days in the resort. The location was fab as it was close enough to the main street of Candidsa so it enabled us to visit the few bars there. The resort itself had a lovely spa which we experienced and would recommend. The food was also excellent having tried their lunch and evening menus. The only thing that we found lacking about the facilities was the lack of sun beds and their umbrellas. Basically there is not enough for the amount of people in the place. We took the free early morning tour which was easy enough and had the advantage of showing us the short cut from the hotel to the main street. It was not lit at night but we found the place very safe. All in all a nice resort which we would visit again.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;HawaiianBlues;Rest and Relaxation;Our second trip to Bali. We stayed four nights with the single objective for rest and relaxation which we definitely achieved with this quieter east coast resort. We stayed in one of the ocean view bungalows which have king size beds, are steps from the pool, and ours even had double sinks in the bathroom. We didn't leave the grounds the entire time we were there and enjoyed the wonderful services of the staff and dining. On our last day, on our drive back to the airport, we decided to stop off at Ubud which we found now to be densely commercialized. The stop quickly reminded us how fortunate we were to have chosen this quieter east coast resort and location. Cooler. Ocean winds and sounds of the surf and waves. And sunny with no rain those four days though it rained;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

The highest point of stay here is the staff, they always help us in many ways with big genuine smile, we did rice field cycling, lunch on the beach and some snorkelling, they have more activities that they can offer to you, they even provide bicycle for free so you can go around the village nearby. Pool is 2.5mtr deep I love it, and they do afternoon tea everyday by the pool, Don't ask me about breakfast, it's an exceed expectations!

Issues are dealt with promptly with a minimum of fuss and all the staff are friendly, helpful and professional. The area is in the quiet part of Bali but can still provide all the entertainment you would need.The only thing to its detriment was the cockerels next door which meant that an early rise was virtually guarenteed;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Rich;Very friendly hotel;Spent a week here after some travelling in Indonesia, great facilities and well set out hotel, great gardens but no beach with nice restaurant (although the menu never altered and no specials board or catch of the day), the spa is also very good and the gym. I would say the staff make the place as they are all very friendly and welcoming and very attentive. One negative, they allow the reservation of sun beds with a towel, only ten umbrellas around the pool with twenty beds and all reserved from opening at 7am, we had breakfast at 7.15am one day and there were only two others in the restaurant and one person in the pool but all beds taken, should adopt a 20 min occupied or lose it rule. Still there is no funnier sight than the towel reserver who has slept in marching about,;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

We particularly enjoyed our breakfasts in garpu restaurant, overlooking the ocean and we enjoyed the little chats with the friendly waiters. The small gym is nicely located in the beautiful Zen garden, which has lovely gazebo ‘s for total peace and quiet. There is a dinner buffet with soft live music twice a week. We went on tours around the island. Ricky our driver, truly made our Bali experience memorable. He was always punctual, speaks english very well, and is very pleasant.

Room was comfortable with nice balcony, wifi could be better but that is just a sidenote. Breakfast was good with fun semi-a la carte idea and restaurant staff were also very friendly. Only downside was that when the hotel started to fill up with people we could´t find place at the pool because it might be little bit too small for the hotel. However on emptier days it was lovely to lay by the pool or on the ""beach""area.

Infact, Mr. Qepeh arranged some special Indian delicacies for us on our last day of stay there. They also have a really nice and great pool, next to their restaurant.

The staff was very friendly, especially at the restaurant. Since my daughter had her birthday on the last day of our stay, I asked the Restaurant manager to reserve a table for breakfast in the first row overlooking the ocean and to decorate it with flowers. They did a very nice job and it was a total surprise for my daughter. As soon as we had started our breakfast a team from the Restaurant came drumming and presenting a small birthday cake with a candle. We thought that was extremely nice and we appreciated that very much. The choice for breakfast was excellent. You could choose from the buffet or order from;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

I was taken ill during my stay and they took time to check on me regularly. I got a room upgrade when I returned, so I could be close to the restaurant. The food in the restaurant is really good and again the staff were very helpful. The whole place is well maintained and clean. I enjoyed a couple of spa treatments and they were professional and relaxing. I dived with zen diving which is next to the hotel, thanks Jos for helping me. I wish I had been able to do more.

Opening the door and looking out was just amazing. The suite was beautiful and well kept, Housekeeping were spot on in every touch of their role and even placed small flowers on the bed. In the evening we sat on the veranda watching the sun setting and the moon rising. Room service delivered the wine and it was hard for us to move to Garpu restaurant for food but we called and asked for a romantic dinner on the beach and that was even more special than any other we have had. Another amazing stay and thank you to everyone for their hospitality.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

The breakfast is lovely, the food is lovely, the service is very efficient. Nothing is too much. We stayed in a luxury bungalow which was really cozy but roomy, air-con is good, the bed is huge and comfy. The WIFI is not good if you have 4 devises, as we had a phone and laptop each, we both run our own businesses, we have to work for an hour each morning but we connected to the restaurant WIFI so this was not a problem. The only thing I would say was a disadvantage really was the beach by the side of the hotel, we both slipped and fell over on the slipway. There is a sign saying, ""slippery when wet"" but it wasn't wet and we both had a nasty fall. Maybe it should say, ""Do not walk on the slipway"" I only want to warn other guests,";5;0;0;0;1;0;1

Location wise its a bit far from other restaurants or tourist spots, so you need to have a cab or vehicle of your own to explore. The room was a bit small, as was the bathroom and we had hoped for a bigger one. It was clean and well maintained otherwise. Overall a good experience.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0

I was advised by Richard to be careful, if need be call if I had a problem and that was pleasing to know that Resort management cared even when leaving. On the first day there sadly I was involved in an accident and rang for advice, again as an older traveler this was comforting to hear words of comfort and i arranged to return to candidasa at Rama where I found that the Balinese care was amazing.

The relaxing atmosphere is second to now. The resort has its own huge and serene Zen Garden where regular free yoga classes with the best teacher are being held. It comprises many areas for sitting and lounging on various types of sun and day beds, even a swinging one that put me to sleep every afternoon.

A free afternoon tea with Balinese as well as Western foods and hot beverages is available daily. And impressive dinners are being served in the evening.

The hotel is well maintained and the staff is sweet and helpful. The hotel has a free shuttle to the Candidasa city every day (remember to sign up the day before), which is worth taking.

The only thing was that the brochure in the room said a foreign exchange service was available 24 hours at reception, but when we went to do this they said they don't offer it. We had breakfast and dinner at the resort's restaurant every day as we had pre-paid for the meals through RCI. The food and service was very good. Overall, we had an amazing time and would definitely return! Next time we will stay in Bali for longer and travel around. We stayed in this one place as it";4;0;0;1;0;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Johan v;Top notch HONEYMOON hospitality!!!;Not only does walking into this residence take your breath away with true Bali beauty, but every day after your first is a day of pampering by the staff of Rama Resort. We went for our honeymoon and truly felt cared for, looked after, and cherished. If you want to relax and experience all of Bali I can't think of a better place. At Rama Candidasa we were... 1) close to all the great restaurants, 2) given all sorts of opportunities to experience all of Bali (Romantic dates, snorkelling, massages etc.), 3) treated like royalty, 4) served amazing food (especially breakfast), 5) and finally, got to enjoy the beauty of Bali from the moment we left our room.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;annagstrout;Lovely rural resort with extremely friendly staff;This was a lovely place for our family of four to stay with my elderly parents. The staff are exceptionally friendly, responsive and professional. The resort is small and intimate, but with quiet spots to be alone in. Good for a family--we were not aware of any heavy partying. The restaurant food selection is good, and prices are decent. It is a short walk, bike or taxi ride to the town, where there are several good restaurants to choose from. The town is quiet. An hour's drive or less brings you to many interesting temples. Several good dive companies are nearby. We are RCI members and will stay again!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

This part of the resort is quite and relaxing. We enjoyed the friendliness of the staff and even locals outside of the resort. We met Richard who is very accommodating and continuously checking about our experience in the resort. It would be nice if there are some entertainment at night while having dinner to introduce/promote Balinese culture or local artist. Overall I would rate our experienced ""VERY GOOD"" and I will include this in my repeat";4;0;0;1;1;0;0

I was apprehensive at first since I read a review from another RCI member who was dissatisfied with their room and it’s location far away from the beach. Suwela welcomed us, and he was very nice and accommodating. He checked the availability of the rooms with ocean view. We lucked out that we were able to upgrade for a small fee per day to an awesome ocean view bungalow room after 3 days. It happened to be our 30th wedding anniversary day when we moved and were able to enjoy it for several more days. It was a few steps to the large and beautiful pool.

Garpu restaurant has excellent food and friendly courteous staff and go out of their way to take care of whatever you need.

We had a lovely week, spent most of the days by the pool, took some walks in the nearby area and a couple of excursions to Amlapura, Teganang, Tirta Ganga and Klungkung. Staff is friendly, and the rooms clean and nice. Ms Dewi was very helpful as we didn't have any accomodation booked closer to the airport for our departure later on.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;AshReview;Relax By the Sea !!!;Rama Candidasa is a great Destination if you want to relax by the Sea side. I booked this Hotel thru DAE timeshare having a bit of concerned experience with them, but the Hotel was great. Pros: Great Sea View Good and Clean Rooms Great Staff Cons: Far from City Food options outside limited It is just besides the Sea and a great view in the Sea. Note that there are very few sand beaches in Candidasa, so do not expect sand beach here. The Hotel has made a bit of sand beach and relaxing chairs facing the sea. The Rooms are clean and the Hotel Staff is great. Rooms are Clean with a Balcony and good Toilet and Bathroom. There are few restaurants (Warung) within 500m to 1 Km, but the place is quite so do not expect much other than the basic stuff. Few Mini markets/stores to buy;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

From the Resort Manager, reception staff, restaurant staff to the pool attendant, we were treated like family. Our stay was forced to be extended by 4 days due to the volcanic eruptions of Mt Agung and the ash cloud causing our flight to be cancelled. Everyone was so helpful and accommodating to our needs. Their genuine kindness and assistance was with enthusiasm and heartfeltness.a special thanks to Anik, Sinta, Ariawan, Dharma, Suwela in particular. I work in tourism and have also worked in hotels so I find critique accom and service probably more so than the average person.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;vglundy;I've had to revise my review (RCI member);"Initially I had given a 3 star review based on our 1st 3 days but I am changing it to a 4 and here are all the details: The initial sighting of the resort shows its beauty. It is stunning, with a beautiful view of the ocean from many locations throughout the resort; especially from the restaurant. Beware it is about 1.5 hours away from the airport depending on traffic (250-300,000rp cost to get there.) Staff: the staff take great care to keep the resort clean and ensure all small details are attended to. They spend hours making flower art around the premisis, cleaning all glass surfaces including lamp covers, sweeping, cutting the grass and clearing water off pathways after every rainfall, taking down and covering all lounge bedding and putting it back out";4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Love the pool and you will need it - there are some beaches in Candidasa however not easily accessible. Recommend scuba diving (next door) and there are plenty of options to go snorkeling (a must). We also were taken out fishing by a local, whose wife (who ran the warung just outside the resort) then cooked our caught fish for lunch. White sands beach by boat is a must. Hope that we will be back.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Margaret682014;Just like family;Rama is a great place we have been there many times as the staff treat us like family this time they have a new restaurant manager that has made some changes for the better and we wish her well.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Chris W;Heaven;Stayed here as a family after a week in Ubud. Arrived and was greeted by friendly staff. Rooms were really clean and comfortable, our cleaner guys were lovely and looked after us well. Beach location is a short distance from the town so easy to visit local restaurants. One of the best pools I have swam in, warm and clean with great views of the beach area. Food was good and varied, nothing too much trouble for staff and chef. Would go back!!!;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Lionel G;Impressed by the People, Property, and view.;"The people are all very friendly; quick to smile, with a friendly greeting and I mean everyone, down to the army of grounds keepers. Special shout out to Sinta, Darma, and Sudewi for taking the time to make sure we had an amazing stay. The Property is beautiful, just as you hope it would be with, a great amount of pride paid to every detail spent keeping the place beautiful. The place is set in a tropical landscape, with fragrant flowers abound. The food is amazing, I have come to expect bland food in resorts, but I must say, I was impressed by the fair on offer, good variety and excellent quality. Ok, the cons, if you want to call them that, is it is a little off the ""beaten path"": 1:45 from the airport and 15min walk from the tiny town";5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Callie D;Excellent and Friendly Service;We spent 8 days at Rama and had an absolutely amazing time there. We went down a short alley and came out at the hotel set back off the main road, which was unexpected. When we arrived, it looked like paradise and the hotel lobby is set outside! The staff greeted us and got us situated in our room. We then went to the dining room and ate dinner, which was delicious. It is also set outside right along the beach and is such a relaxing atmosphere. We were consistently waited on by the wait staff and the manager. Every morning while there we were greeted by the staff and asked about our room and whether we slept well. They were always asking about our well being to ensure we were well taken care of. They helped us set up our trips around the island as well which were absolutely;5;0;1;1;0;0;1

Near the pool and the bar and restaurant. Even though very close it was always quiet. The pool was great and we spent a lot of time there. The food is to die for all very fresh and tasty and well priced. We went on the White Sand beach snorkling and beach BBQ beach trip. Wow!!! best day out I have had in Bali and we have been there many many times. We were sick (curse you Bali Belly) and the hotel got the Dr for me and also the Spa made a special Ginger Tea which helped a lot. They were all so helpful and genuinely concerned for our wellbeing and nothing was too hard for them.

The surrounding is peaceful, away from the crowd, but in front of the beautiful ocean. The property is highlighted by a beautiful pool overlooking the ocean, with gourmet restaurant.. The room, manicured garden, wonderful staff are all FIVE STARS! There are also many wonderful attractions nearby, such as the Water Palace, rice terraces, monkey forest, old town.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Rosa n;Stunning;Great feelgood, relaxing resort on a beautiful stretch of coastline in a much quieter, less commercial area than Kuta, Legian and Seminyak. Incredibly friendly, obliging management and staff and excellent accommodation, food and facilities including well equipped modern gym. The existence of a top dive shop immediately next door is a definite plus for divers and snorkelers. Diving in the area is very good. This was our 5th time back and we look forward to many more.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;arjunv87;Great to relax;If your idea is to relax and this tops the list , if ur here to explore Bali , I wouldn’t recommend this since it’s a good 2 hour drive from most of the attractions , the resort offers some good activities for the guest at free of cost , if ur planning to come down I would suggest take a cab at the airport , do a temple tour so that u can avoid going back to city Please avoid the airport taxi it’s very costly , luckily I found a transport and tour service guy and it worked out very cheap when the airport transfer by the hotel was 450000 Indonesian rupee and the airport taxi charged 50 dollars I found a guy who agreed to do a temple tour and drop to the hotel at 60 dollars , when the car costs 40 dollar per person /hr , it was quite a deal and the best part was the driver was;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

The rain shower, was a little blocked so didn't really have the same effect, however bathroom was very large and clean. The food was amazing and great value for money. We thought the hotel would be on a beach due to being on the coast, however it is a shear drop to the rocky sea below. Hotel staff happy to help and order taxi's if needed.

After a lengthy drive, initially on busy roads, we started to see some of the beautiful Bali scenery, and eventually noticed we were running alongside the sea. The Rama has a favoured position along this coast, and after entering the splendid reception building, modelled on traditional Balinese styles, we were taken to our apartment in the impeccable grounds, with lovely water-features and simple Hindu prayer offerings everywhere. We were here for 3 nights, and we both agreed it was one of the most peaceful places we have ever visited, with much to enjoy without charging around.

The staff is lovely and so willing to accommodate your needs. The rooms, particularly those close to the sounds of the crashing waves, are so restful, clean and spacious. I simply loved my stay here and would eagerly return. My routine was to wake early, make a cup of instant coffee provided in the room and go sit in one of the cabanas on the sand to watch the sunrise. It was very hard to leave this place.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

We took the wrong one and had to pay 20.000, Rp twice before we where on the beach.

This was the only hotel that didn't offer us any specials for honeymoon and declined to give us a room upgrade even though half of the hotel was empty at the time. The staff at the restaurant is very unfriendly and ignoring you a lot. And the food is average I would say.

Initially I was told an extra USD$50/n. Then I asked again just before we left, and was told USD$80/n for a seafront cottage but they only had single beds. Again, as an extra USD$560 for the week, forget it!! When we arrived, the Regent sales guy had a chat with us and offered it to us for USD$40/n but I still couldn't see the value in it as we'd seen 4* hotels in Kuta for less than that. Never mind!

We stayed here in October 2016 for pleasure. This time for June a much better time of year for us personally for the weather was warm still but not as humid! Our greetings from the start staff remembered my husband and myself and made our friends feel just as welcome! The staff, gardens, pool, restaurant, bungalows and service is outstanding! The menu was somewhat different than our last visit but change is good! Our massage training for 5 days at the onsite spa was exceptional! Very experienced trainers who we are very grateful for.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Akruti V;Good place for the one who need to relax and have a quiet vacation!!;Candidasa is an area in Bali which is too quiet and is for the people who wishes to have quiet vacation. We were on a trip with our friends so for us staying to this place was a nightmare as all we went to Bali was for Partying. So the area is too far from Kuta and Seminyak and going to some club could be too expensive as well as too time consuming. Pool area of the hotel was damn pretty. When we went for the breakfast in the morning we reached there just 15 minutes before the breakfast closing time and the staff was asking us to hurry and grab everything that we needed as they wanted to clear the breakfast spread. I have been to many places but I never have been asked to rush so much for my breakfast in any of my vacations. Room were quiet big but furniture was very old though;4;0;1;1;1;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;RedwoodResident;No complaints!;This is a lovely hotel with very friendly staff. It was booked for my by Zen Divers (reviewed separately) next door as part of a dive and stay package. The location was perfect as I dived each morning and only had to walk 2-3 minutes to check my gear and board the dive boat. My wife had more than enough to occupy her while I dived, and we had romantic afternoons and evenings together. They have an excellent chef. We had two very good dinners there. The complementary breakfast was good as well. The spa is also very good. We both did a spa package shortly after arrival and were not disappointed. I probably would have never seen or heard of this hotel if I had not come to dive, but i am glad I did. The grounds are beautiful and our deluxe cottage was very well appointed.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Town for shopping is a bit of a hike but the resort has a shuttle to take you in and bring you back, not a lot of shops to choose from as its basically a small country seaside village. Resort is right on the beach, the restaurant protrudes out over the water with stunning views and beach access is via some stairs. Very friendly staff and nothing is to much trouble for them. I fell sick whilst there and was bed ridden for 4 days, the resort took very good care of us and the local doctor came to the room......very good service.

My wife was fasting at the time and the Maitre D’ ensured that she had a meal that she could eat for breakfast. Our baby was treated like royalty – he had so much fun in the pool. Our cottage was the first next to the pool - oh what a view in the morning. All throughout the night you are caressed by the sound of the crashing waves.

Some reviews said it was long trip, but getting the resort to pick me up was the best review i read and just over an hour to a half. The Nice driver kept me informed of local activities, but I then decided not to leave, but dine in the Resort. A warm welcome from a very proffessional management team, the team of staff were great and the simplicity of the menu was as good as in its delivery and extreamly good tastes.

We found the complex well cared for with meticulous gardening and a very attractive pool area. Our suite room was large and comfortable. We ate many meals at the restaurant. The menu had a broad range of cuisine...Italian, Thai, Indian and Balinese. I enjoyed a multi-coarse birthday dinner for two specially set up for us next to the ocean. It was beautifully done. We also tried some of the alternate restaurants that were not far away and they ranged good to excellent ( ...especially Vincent's... it was fabulous!) The view from the pool was great and we spent many hours just unwinding there. However, one of the best assets of the hotel were the staff...they were exceptional...;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Raviraj Rodrigues;Best place to unwind in Bali;The resort is located in Candidasa on East Bali and is a 90 min drive from Denpasar airport. Candidasa does not have the urban trapping of Kuta or Seminiyak. It has a more rustic feel with its small warungs and serene coastline. There are some good cafes too. The resort itself is located in a secluded area by the sea and has a relaxed feel to it. The resort though not large, has a bit of a spacious feel give the layout. The rooms are big enough for a couple with a small child. We had two children and with the extra bed the room felt a bit cramped, but this was our choice (as our children cannot sleep alone). The staff were exceptional at all times. No where have I seen such hospitality (even in India which is renowned for its Guest Hospitality). The breakfast options adequate,;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Travel: this place is a drive away from the airport. So if you have had a loong connecting flight you need a breath of patience. The drive is good. Best is to land in day time so you can see the city while you drive to the hotel. Hotel: lovely place. Peace. Calm. Yourself. Beautiful. Warm staff. Helpful staff. Some words to describe this place. Note: the AC unit in the room is not adequate for the size of the room plus the humidity of the place. Food: The food quality is very good, however the options are limited. Weather: super humid. If you know of how Bombay is in India like, pretty much similar weather. Sunscreen with SPF 70 is best to beat the sun tan. Swimwear: I recommend;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

Almost all staffs are friendly and willing to greet you. The manager will check and explain the room facilities whereas I have the bellboy put down the luggage and then go at the other resorts. They will sometimes ask for your advices and are there anything you need. Nearby 24 hours clinic is also at reasonable price, they provide pickup and return after the staff telling my situation of minor decompression sickness. It takes just several minutes.

We arrived in the early hours of the morning and were greeted with cold towels to freshen up with and fresh juice by a friendly and helpful employee. This set the tone for the whole holiday. We had a room on the sea front - it was stunning. The green areas were just beautiful, the pool a perfect temperature and on the sea front, and the restaurant very good. We also treated ourselves to a couple of different types of massage and again they were top notch. But what really set this place apart was the outstanding hospitality - nothing was too much trouble, our names were used and remembered and the staff were attentive without being intrusive. It was a bit more pricey than other places in Bali;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Daydreamer58;Seafront Hotel;This is a nice seafront hotel. We had rooms on the garden side which meant no view at all. But this is of course price-sensitive and we had been there with a tour. The advantage was that there was no noise at all, while on the ocean side you'll find the pool and the restaurant. For a roundtrip it was o.k. but for a longer stay we would have regarded it as too remote. The whole atmosphere was shaped by the stylish concrete buildings with country-specific ornamentation. Breakfast was predominantly Asian, In addition the standard egg dishes could be ordered. For dinner you may find modest options outside the resort, but we preferred to stay at the hotel and had the very only Indonesian rice table on our trip. Recommendable!;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

My aunt and I were in Amed and it was not what we wanted at all. As we had our mind set on a beautiful resort and the ability to walk on and off the property with ease. We only had 2 days so we quickly got on trip advisor and found Rama. It looked perfect; how we wanted to spend our last day. We didn't have any phone service so I contacted my friend via wifi and he was able to call. Rama sent a car for us within the hour. The driver exceeded our expectations, spoke English very well and was more of a tour guide.

Our room or bungalow was beautiful with several Balinese touches such as the flower petals left on the beds every day and the fresh clean towels wrapped up into fun animal shapes. The bathroom was spacious and clean with a beautiful huge shower. The food was lovely with ample portions and great service. Breakfast for most nationalities was catered for and the evening meals had a wide selection of Indonesian/Pacific Rim cuisine as well as Western dishes.

The hotel is beautiful; the gardens stunning. Our room was comfortable. I loved the pool area where we spent our days relaxing and reading with the sound of the crashing waves and amazing views to Lombok. And as always, the Balinese staff were so lovely!

Villa by the pool is worth the upgrade as the rooms in main hotel at the rear of the resort is fairly average. We were lucky as they had one left when we arrived. Very quiet resort and the sound of the ocean breaking against the rocks at your door is beautiful. Restaurant is good value for money and the food was nice. Staff are super friendly too. Wouldn't really recommend for a family with children, but for a couple or a small group of family/friends ideal getaway. Main town only a few minutes drive/bike has enough variety of restaurants to try somewhere new every night if you don't eat at the rest restaurant.

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;MaureenMurphy-Dyson;Rama Candidasa-Our Second Home!;We have just returned from our 9th year of staying at Rama Candidasa. Each year we have thought about trying something new in Bali but we always return to Rama. Our room is clean, pretty and large. The staff is absolutely wonderful...sincere, friendly, happy and full of fun. We rent a scooter while we are there (3 weeks) and go to the more touristy destinations on Bali or the less known parts. It is a super way to see everything and keep cool at the same time. This year Rama Candidasa offered something very special...a guided walking tour of rice paddies and a beautiful river for a very reasonable rate. Our excellent guide, Darma, is from the village that borders on the private lands we visited and that is why we were able to take the walk on private land. Our driver picked;4;0;0;1;1;1;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Nga100;Peace and Quiet;Upon arriving at our resort we were greeted with a cooling refreshing drink and a wet towel for our faces! Our concierge was very friendly and most helpful even tho it was 12 at night. Our booking was for myself, my husband and our son(15) aswell as my best friend and her husband and their son(15). Our sons room was situated on the ground level with 2 king size beds, air con and very clean. The adults rooms we had were on the 2nd level which had king size beds and all air conditioned. All rooms had tv and free Wifi. Rama Candidasa is the place to go when you don't want the noise, the hustle and bustle and free of the city smell. Located right by the water makes it a glorious place to have their buffet breakfast which is changed up every morning with something new! The resort;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;alexandermay73;A great place to relax;Lovely to be away from the crowds of Kuta and discover this gem of a resort. It's location in Candidasa was such a positive. Nice restaurants, beautiful scenery and friendly locals made for a great trip. The resort itself was positioned at the waters edge, to eat breakfast and dinner in the waterfront restaurant was such a treat especially coupled with the friendly staff. Our regular waiter Ganti was so hospitable and always smiling! The grounds are also lovely and well maintained. Be sure to treat yourself at the day spa! Our room was an ocean front bungalow and well worth the extra $ for the view alone. Thank you Darma and all the friendly staff we will definitely be back.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;lifelover9;Delux and Peaceful;High-end of Candidasa options with excellent management. A little far to walk for nightlife but who cares when taxis are so cheap and restaurants even pay for them. Best features for me: Large quality villas, Seaside views, Sunset vistas, Large well maintained pool, Excellent restaurant, Beautiful gardens, lake and reading spots. Overall, its probably a little quiet for young folk but I was very satisfied and can't wait to return.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Dan S;Very nice.;Nice place, very clean and well groomed. This is the slower side of bali and close to Padang bay and the ferries to the gili's . The morning breakfast was incredible with western food and traditional flare. The view from The dining room is great and again the staff can't do enough. The rooms are nice and if you can afford a suite with a private pool, DO IT! They are to die for. The beach is marginal but well kept behind a total break and snorkelling is average. The buffet night was very average with not a lot of selection. The food was good but a limited amount of choices. At the other end of the property there is a great patio with a great view. This would be a good resort for honeymooners or even a family. The small village of candidasa is close and has restaurants and;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

She guided us very well about which places we should visit near candidassa and helped us getting our rental motorcycle. Mr. Richard's recommendations and advices were perfect and really helped us a lot in planning our Bali trip. The hotel has a very good restaurant with a great ocean view. You can sit there all day long with the great cocktails served and enjoy the serene atmosphere. They also serve good Indian food. I tried their kings dinner which is an elaborate presentation of all of indonesia's dishes. The serving is huge two of us could hardly complete even half of;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Candidasa Karangasem Bali;Ramayana Candidasa Bali;Anna B;Gorgeous!;We had an incredible time here. Every aspect of our stay was super well attended to by the wonderful staff and it was a breath of fresh air to stay at such a high class place. The pool and facilities were amazing and the spa a dream. Everything was slightly more expensive than other places in Bali, but it was well worth it to have a full resort experience for a fraction of the price it would have cost in the US. We look forward to returning one day soon!;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;anita b;Very private;What a gem! Quiet and really private. We liked the contemporary design and the fact we didn't need to share our pool with other guest as it in the hotel. Our room was very comfortable. The food is very tasty and fresh after visited so many places, we think their food is the best so far. The villas managment was supportive and helpful. They went out of their way to help us.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;Arianna L;THE MOST AMAZING PLACE TO STAY IN ULUWATU;We stayed here late September 2022 originally for three days but we extended to five after the first day of arriving because of how gorgeous the villa was! The views are stunning, the villa we had included a private pool and was just what you needed after a day of surfing. The rooms are huge and the villa is very accomodating for all your needs including moped hire to get around the island. Could not reccommend hideaway villas more, we’re hoping to come back again next year and stay for longer!;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;100_RABHG;Best luxury property in Uluwatu!;It’s a really nice luxury property based in Uluwatu.. close to most of the attractions of uluwatu.. temple, bars, beaches and the clubs.. we upgraded to a 2 bedroom pool villa with a panoramic view.. and believe me, the view is worth every extra penny. The villa is nice and modern, well maintained and pool is pretty big too. The staff is really sweet too. They don’t have an intercom, so all your requests would be through WhatsApp. The turnaround time can be a little long at times but they always get your work done with a smile on their faces. Breakfast was pretty good and sumptuous too. We hired a bike and they have got nice Yamaha bikes with their villa names painted on it.. helps in the hilly area of uluwatu.. We met with a small accident and damaged the bike a lil too..;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;Melissa;A must visit resort :);During our honeymoon this was our first location for 3 nights, really enjoyed Hideaway Resort! Definitely hidden at a beautiful spot, not too many villas so that makes it nice, relaxing and personal. The staff was very friendly and helpfull. Thank you all for making our stay and honeymoon so perfect. Floating breakfast was great, the spa, the food, we enjoyed it all! The villa with private pool was very nice, we will definitely visit Hideaway again when we come back to Bali. :) see you!! Nick & Melissa;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;BrianTC;Amazing stay with minor cleanliness issue;Room was very beautiful with a nice private pool, great view and spacious bathroom. Service was also excellent but some minor issue on cleanliness. We used the bathtub and when it overflowed a little there were also some dead insects and insects feces that overflowed in the bathroom floor. However we reported this right away and they cleaned it up. They even gave us free floating breakfast to say sorry for the mess. Do not get me wrong the bedroom, pool and sala area was very clean. I guess they just overlooked the cabinet sides of the bathroom. Overall the hotel is great and would love to stay there again. Breakfast served was amazing. Location is also 15 minutes away from Sundays Beach Club and Omnia, and 20 minutes away from Single Finn which was perfect.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;nancycinx;❤️;It was our second time visiting this beautiful secluded villas. The staffs were very friendly and nice. However, it would be nice if the sign were bigger, because it is quite hard to find it especially during night time. And there are things you need to improve about food. Breakfast needs varieties or maybe buffet style, and we once order fish and chips but it wasn’t that good. Other than that, we were satisfied with the service and all the staff that took care of us while we were staying there.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;Zachtan83;Literally a 'hideaway';Tucked away in a quaint location in Uluwatu, this villa offers a quiet escape from the busy sounds of Kuta or Seminyak. We enjoyed our stay there alot. You will need to drive in from the main road for a few mins before reaching it, but security and safety is all good. Food and amenities are all decent, with a spa and gym avail. They also offer services like floating breakfast in your pool, in-house bbq dinner, or romantic dinner set up.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;Anna Wilson;Romantic Stay in Suite with Pool;From the moment we arrived, we were treated with amazing hospitality. The hotel is peaceful with a location hidden away from the busy streets of Uluwatu. The room was beautiful and very clean. We were excited about having a pool in our room. It was definitely worth it! The complimentary breakfast was delicious every day. Riri was so helpful to us. She made sure we enjoyed our food and did everything she could to ensure we enjoyed our time. We ordered a floating breakfast one morning. It was very romantic. Surya assisted in setting up the breakfast and also made sure that we had everything we could want or need. He was very friendly.

Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;TeeWebster;Beautiful stay!;My boyfriend and I stayed in the Batur villa, having its own private plunge pool and almost all glass around one side and front of the room, depicting amazing views of the sunset. The bathroom was clean and it too overlooked the same views and our plunge pool. The hotel staff are always checking in on us and we especially loved conversing with both Edy and Surya who were really genuine and down to earth. We met them during our breakfasts which wasn’t a buffet style as such, but the options were abundant. This place overall is tucked away but it’s also quite central to everything we wanted to do here in Uluwatu. We have been so lucky to have not only chosen a hotel with a great location, but a place with such accommodating staff and spectacular facilities. Daily cleaning,;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Wow, their Villas are absolutely gorgeous and their service is even better. Their staff is trustworthy, we asked to leave our luggage after checking out because we were going to the islands and they gladly kept it for us and everything was intact. I am absolutely impressed with everything, their pool was perfect and the place was big enough for 3 adults!;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;Leanna2263;Blissful Serenity;After a fairly hectic couple of weeks in busy Canggu and Bingin ... the Hideaway Villas was the most welcome and perfect little piece of Bali heaven before heading back home. With impeccable service from our welcome and right through our stay, we SO enjoyed the beautiful peace and tranquility of this gorgeous hotel - and private plunge pool was the icing on the cake 😉✨😎 highly recommended for a real break away from it all ... but also relatively close to famed surf spots and beaches - special mention for Ulan, the most gorgeous front of house manager, and a Thankyou to the whole team for their genuine care and ‘nothing is a problem’ attitude ... a real Bali experience (but without the dust and noise😁) ❤️❤️❤️;5;;;;;;
Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;AKPN;Beautiful villa views;My husband and I stayed here recently for five nights. We had a great time.

It was spacious, clean and to have a pool at our front door was beautiful. It had everything we needed for a relaxing getaway. Food choice in the restaurant was a beautiful mix of local specialities and European dishes at very reasonable prices. The spa treatments available were extensive and very reasonably priced as were tour packages on offer. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

Room was in a good location/clean and roomy the best thing about the room was the access to our own pool, room was lovely and very relaxing. Loved the outdoor area. Only negative thing we found was no shopping and eatery close to property and 7 nights a bit too long. Next time we will stay probably 4 nights and 4 nights in Kuta. We loved our holiday at Hideway Villas if you are looking at a relaxing trip then this is the place.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

If you’re looking for a quiet relaxing/time with your significant other, Hideaway is perfect! The a-la-carte breakfast menu gives you a number of western and Indonesian choices. Try to request the top floor villas for the highest view over the treetops. Also there is no ‘bar’ so if you’re looking to relax by the pool with a drink, I’d recommend stocking up your villa fridge with whatever alcoholic beverage you enjoy.";4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;Anton G;Could be much better!;I stayed in a one bedroom pool villa with my friend for 5 nights. First impressions of the villas were amazing! The layout and amount of space you get for the price is almost unbeatable elsewhere in Bali. Hideaway Villas are a great place to relax and get away from the more busy areas on the island, though there aren’t many restaurants or places to eat that are walkable from the hotel. This hotel has great potential to become even better though are were a few things that I felt let it down.;4;1;1;0;0;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Hideaway Villas Bali;Bernard Sim;Remarkable.;The location is very private and if you didn't know Uluwatu well you'd probably miss it. Hideaway Villas has a long drive-through valley of greenery before reaching the actual villa grounds. This makes the experience that much more magical not forgetting the charming sight of cattle along the drive in. The cleanliness of the villa is something that needs to be flagged out. It is spotlessly clean and modern to the touch. The design had an immediate WOW effect on us and from the very beginning, a part of me told me that I would never want to leave this place. True enough. I never did. It was really hard at least.;5;0;0;0;0;1;0

Perhaps couple of improvements would be i) one of the towels had a small stain; and ii) pool could be cleaner with some debri floating around.

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Rahul A;Excellent property for a luxurious stay;I stayed at Radisson Blu Uluwatu with wife for 4 nights in Sept’22. This is the review for the same. Location and Accessibility: 5/5 Hotel is situated in a really good place. It is close to Padang Padang, Uluwatu and Dreamland beach as well as Uluwatu temple. It takes just 5-15 mins by 2 wheeler to access any of these places. Property and Rooms: 5/5 Property is really beautiful and well-maintained. We stayed at Panoramic view rooms and rooms were spacious, comfortable. Esp nice was the nice balcony provided. You can’t directly see the sea through the room through. It is visible at an angle only. The swimming pool is also outstanding. Its quite big with trees to provide cover and very clean.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Kim S;Lux;Stayed here 6 nights late August in a deluxe room.  It was a large room with a lovely king size bed and a small sofa corner. Nice and big balcony connected to a small terrace, witch we never used. Very large and lovely bathroom. It was our last stop in our 3.5 weeks Bali/Komodo tour, and we needed a luxury place where we could relax. For that it was perfect. The large garden/swimming pool area was perfect for our need for relaxing. It’s a 10 min walk from Bingin Beach, but we will not recommend badly walking people to go there because of the stairs. But it’s the place to go to watch the sunset. If you don’t want to use the restaurant’s on the hotel, Bingin has some options, otherwise you have to go to the main road.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;timoschwind;Great hotel with even greater service;It's a very nice and clean hotel. Check-In was super pleasant and the rooms were great.

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;ANDY H;Lovely new hotel for staying in Uluwatu;Booked online after seeing a good deal, and we were not disappointed! The hotel, the room and the facilities were all fantastic and felt 5* - room was huge and very clean with all the mod cons, and the pool area is beautiful! The only downside worth mentioning is that we struggled with outside noise - we had noisy neighbours and the walls weren’t very thick, and could also hear external noises e.g. motorbikes etc. Earrplugs did the trick for this noise, but worth noting if you’re a light sleeper.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Also, they have a huge, wonderful room, it was my favorite spot in the hotel. The breakfast is delicious, there are many options for all tastes. The only thing I didn't love was the food at the pool bar, we ordered a ceaser salad and a nicoise salad and there was very little protein (chicken and tuna). Otherwise I loved it and I would go back to the hotel for sure.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

The quality of the food was good and reasonably priced. We had one of the top floor rooms with large balcony which caught a nice breeze. The room was clean, the bed very comfortable and had a coffee pod machine. There was also a nice turn down service each night. Nothing was an issue when requested. There however are only two issues: Firstly the air conditioning in the top floor room was woefully inadequate probably due to the vaulted ceiling. The room could very much benefit from a ceiling;4;0;0;0;1;1;1

The rooms? We had the suite and boy was it worth it. A huge balcony going around our room, with the most insane view of the ocean. Massive room with a great bed and aircon. The restaurants were great and we ate here almost everyday because of the lockdown and Nyepi.

I loved the big bathtub! - Good selection at breakfast (eggs, Asian dishes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, meat, bread, sweets, and cheese--though adding some oatmeal would be nice!) - Large pool and lush territory with lots of flowers and greenery.

Also, the hotel offers free shuttle to Uluwatu Temple where you can enjoy a Kecak Dance at sunset, it's a must, don't miss it!

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Mattf;Beautiful resort overall.;We really enjoyed our 3 night stay at Raddison Blu. The resort Is very well maintained with delightful landscaped gardens, huge tastefully decorated rooms and a massive pool to top it off. There are many different areas to relax around the pool so it never really feels crowded. The only criticism I can think of was the lack of variety and freshness on offer at the breakfast buffet. I found myself walking around in circles not particularly being enticed by anything on offer.e was great.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Spent 8 nights with family - relaxed - lovely bars, great food and awesome staff.... Service is superb, always ready to help, great one touch support line. Loved every moment of our stay. Kids club was helpful - the staff helped arrange cars for our trips within Bali and helped us try motorbiking too... Radisson Blu is the place to be in Bali - away from the hustle and bustle of more busy beach places like Kuta, Nusa Dua etc - yet accessible....me and my family loved our stay here.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Jo K;Beautiful Resort;Stayed at this beautiful resort with another couple on a Luxury Escapes package in November. The package was very generous, included breakfast each day and two meals for the duration of our stay as well as a massage each. The resort is quiet and beautifully appointed. The pool area is expansive and not difficult to get a cabana or lounge. Our rooms were spacious, clean and modern. My personal view is the restaurants on site were a little lacking to come up to 5 star level. The breakfast offerings are vast but could do with some extra attention to detail. A 15 minute walk will take you into Uluwatu if you don't want to wait for the shuttle bus.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;RichieC001;Amazing Hotel!;This was the first hotel we arrived at to kick off our Honeymoon! After 20 hours of travel it was extremely impressive to turn up to this hotel with their amazing location and views from reception and each room. The rooms are huge and are very well set out and presented. Breakfast here is also incredible with a great variety and egg station. This hotel is in a perfect location to get around Uluwatu – you can walk from the hotel for 10 minutes to hit the strip where there are nice restaurants and bars close by. If you hire a scooter from the hotel you can also get around to all the close beaches and restaurants as well.

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Versus G;Nice hotel with two incredible restaurants;The property: We booked a room at this beautiful, luxury hotel. Our room was on the 5th floor facing the ocean and the pool and it came with a balcony where we enjoyed drinking coffee at sunrise. The hotel has a fully-equipped gym that is well maintained. The pool area is huge and there are various lounge chairs and cabanas, as well as a bar, surrounding the pool. The pool is well lit at night giving the property a romantic feel at night time. However, the pool closes rather early. The pool also seems very shallow, so not really great for guests that like hanging out in the pool as it barely comes up to one's thighs. The hotel has two restaurants on the property, which I think are the highlight and benefit of staying at this hotel.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;desakanisa;One of The Best of My Weekend Escape;Nice hotel, what I love the most in this hotel is The Breakfast! The breakfast is so delicious. Room was clean. Overall this hotel is recommended for family, friends or honeymooner;5;0;0;0;0;1;0

The rooms are huge (we had a ocean view studio) and we had a lovely wrap around balcony. Like others have mentioned the rooms could be better sound proofed but we were lucky and didn't have noisy neighbours. The hotel never felt crowded and you could always find a deck chair or cabana.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Jen_B73;Excellent place to finish our trip;We ended our trip here for 2 nights after spending 8 nights in other parts of Bali (Nusa Lembongan and Keremas). The hotel is relatively new and the rooms very well designed. Plenty of sun beds surrounding the huge pool. The location is fairly remote and you need to use Taxis to go anywhere or hire a scooter. There are some surf shops and a restaurant/bar about 10 minute walk up the driveway. Impossibles surf beach is a 10minute walk away down a very steep path and from there you can walk over the rocks to Bingin at low tide. The spa was lovely;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Dennis N;Wonderful hotel, best we have experienced in Bali;The Radisson Blu Uluwatu is a true gem. It is a rather new hotel on the Uluwatu peninsula, which is a beautiful and not so crowded part of Bali (relative to the Seminyak or Ubud areas). The hotel is close to a laid back surfer village with nice stores, restaurants and bars. The hotel offers a free shuttle to different beaches close by as well as to the Uluwatu Temple (schedule available at reception). Upon arrival we were assigned to room 615, the room itself was beautiful (as all rooms in the hotel), but lacked a view. We asked reception whether they could relocate us to a room with a nicer view, which they kindly agreed to: we were assigned room 727 (in a different building and higher up, which has a fantastic view). The rooms itself are very spacious, have very comfortable;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;jemoser;No real view on the ocean, but a fantastic swimming pool;The situation of the brand new hotel on the cliff in Uluwatu between Bingin and Padang Padang beaches, far from the crowd, is excellent. A direct view on the ocean, however, is made impossible by trees and walls surrounding the premises. This is frustrating and mitigates the interest for a superior room said to offer ocean view. Only a micro-boutique is available at the spa, which is practically useless. As the hotel is quite remote from the civilisation, availability of a small store and an automatic teller machine would be a big plus. The room and balcony were very nice as well as the services and restaurants. The big asset of the hotel is its fantastic swimming pool and the very large, well maintained area surrounding it.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;richard r;5 nights in corner suite;We stayed for 5 nights at the new Radisson blu at Uluwatu.

We upgraded to the corner balcony suite, which offered sunset and ocean views. The room was nice and the balcony very good, although the ocean views were poor and we were on the wrong wing for a full sunset.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

You can walk out to the road and get great food for half the price. It was nice and quiet for a honeymoon. Great place to stay for few days.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Jack S;Thank you for an amazing stay.;I love this resort. From the minute we walked in we felt like we were home. All the amenities are amazing. We booked with luxury escapes and we received all these complementary dinners, massages and cocktails. Well worth the money we paid. The food they serve at this resort is just faultless. The ocean view rooms are huge and the bathrooms are huge too. I would definitely stay here again. Excellent hotel. Love this resort.;5;1;0;0;1;0;0
Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;syndromicgirl;Wow, highly value for money!;My fiancé and I stayed at the Radisson just last week for 2 nights to prepare for our Bali wedding and we were truly impressed with the property itself, the architecture, the best Italian restaurant ever and how value for money it was. Nothing to fault them for especially with the amount you pay, we are Radisson Blu gold members so you have perks like late checkout, free breakfast for 2, 15% off F&B etc which made our stay really value for money.;4;1;0;0;0;0;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Rebecca;Did not disappoint;Our family of four (including 2 children aged 10 and 11) had a Luxury Escapes package. We found our stay at Radisson Blue to be excellent. Everything about our experience was 5 star - the rooms, the pool, the food and drink offerings and the architecture of the resort were all lovely. The location is also excellent, with plenty of shops, cafes and beaches at your doorstep. Although the resort is very up market and modern, it somehow still seems to retain the charm of Bali, largely thanks to the friendly and attentive staff. I would love to come back.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Londontraveller92;Perfect for a relaxing break;Most of the guests seem to be on a Luxury Escape break which is really good value and seems a regular on the site. As the hotel is very new everything is in good condition and there are plenty of sun beds and cabanas around the pool. The hotel isn’t very near any shops or restaurants so unless you’re prepared to get taxis everywhere you’re stuck with what’s on offer at the hotel. There’s only a few items there’s a surcharge for with the Luxury Escapes vouchers. The hotel is also quite remote for other attractions in Bali so it’s much more;5;1;1;0;0;0;0

We were immediately impressed by the breezy open aired lobby and modern styling.of the hotel which given it was so new meant that pretty much everything was immaculate. We stayed in the 1 bedroom ocean suite which was massive and very comfortable. We had a spacious wrap around balcony with a great view of the ocean and pool. The bed was comfortable and our daughter loved her pink cot. The breakfast buffet was of a good quality although could have had a bit more variety. The pool area which is the main area of the hotel was fantastic. Lots of shallow areas for little kids to play around and it never felt crowded.;4;0;0;0;1;0;1

My only complaint was a misunderstanding with a drink charge but reception kindly solved the problem without any drama. I also wish the pillows weren't so big. They need to invest in thinner pillows as it made it difficult to sleep (but that's a privileged problem to have really!).

The hotel location is a bit far from shops and other restaurants although we did walk to Bingin one day (about 15 minutes walk...then down 188 steps, then back up 188 steps) but the food options at the hotel are very good. We were there after the Australian school holidays so it didn't feel crowded and there weren't really any kids around (there is a kids club) so it felt like quite a grown up, sophisticated resort. Location wise it's not really ideal as a hub for daytrips to the south western beaches (Seminyak is about 90 minutes by car) although some people;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;jesssean1;relaxed seclusion;Stayed for 5 nights using the LE package. Our room was upgraded to a panoramic view on arrival (thank you!!) Beautiful big room, made to feel even more due to the high ceilings. Fresh cut flowers each day was a nice touch aswell. Great spot to just stop & unwind.... possibly a little secluded if you have a young family (like us) with no kids pool & the playroom was just a bare room with few tables & a TV. But this was the only downfall we had. Great breakfast options, very fresh & tasty! The walk down the steps to the small beach is worth the walk. Great spot to sit & watch the surfers.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Hundson;Great and modern hotel;We stayed in a studio suite at the hotel for 5 nights, it was really big and had a perfect terrace where we could see the ocean. The hotel is very modern and everything feels new, the pool and breakfast was outstanding. The service at the hotel was really good, everyone in the staff really tried to do their best for their guests. When thinking about what to improve: Cleaning of the room time is between 9-17, for me that is to long I want it at the latest 12. But after talking with the staff they helped us with that. There are a lot of great beaches close to the hotel, the hotel have free transfer to Padang Padang but that one was a big dissapointment for us. A transfer to for example dreamland beach would have been much better.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Hablink;Lovely oasis in Uluwatu;We just returned from Bali and, after traveling around, this may have been our favorite hotel of the trip. I’d definitely recommend this hotel for a quiet, upscale oasis and home base in southern Bali. The rooms are very spacious and well appointed and the pool is amazing with lots of places to hang out while slightly submerged (often necessary in Balinese humidity). While you do need to drive to get to beaches, the hotel runs a shuttle so it’s fairly easy to get around.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

The hotel is near to the best restaurants, spa and beaches. It’s 5 minutes (by scooter) to Padang Padang beach and 13 minutes to Dreamland beach, our favorite! They also have a shuttle to some beaches and temples. I really loved the hotel and would definitely recommend to everyone!;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Our room was amazing and we were even upgraded for free! The room was spacious and had everything we could ever want. Comfortable bed, balcony overlooking the pool and the beach and the bathroom was amazing. There is a walk way that will take you to Impossible Beach-not for the faint of heart, but we had a good little hike and great beers at the beach. Downsides is it is rather far from the main road, no ATM or money exchange on site. However they are a fairly new hotel and still figuring out what people need. Overall, we had a great stay!;4;0;1;0;1;0;1

The rooms are spacious and if you are lucky you might get an ocean glimpse. You can access impossible beach at low tide but but check out monkey etiquette and be aware they are steep steps.

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Natasha B;MR IRAWAN in Lookout Bar this one is for you!;I never really do reviews. As a matter this is my very first review on TripAdvisor. I am not usually easily impressed by mixology, however I felt the need to write a review on this gentleman’s cocktail. I will definitely come back for the food, room quality etc. but mainly for this amazing cocktail (Singapore Sling) especially made by Mr. Irawan. Such a good personality and a remarkable mixologist. Thank you for the stay. You will see me again in future. Cheers!;5;;;;;;

Great spacious rooms (we got a free upgrade), large pool and nice views of the sea from the cocktail bar. Next to the hotel there is a small and isolated rocky beach (called ""impossible beach"") which is absolutely worth a visit. The hotel is in a more quiet part of Bali, but within 10 min walk you find a lot of little bars, restaurants etc. Also easy to rent scooters and go around yourself. Hotel also offers shuttle bus to nearby beach and Uluwatu temple.";5;0;1;0;1;0;0

I stayed in the Deluxe Room which was overlooking the main pool and parts of the beach, this gave me a lovely view of the sunrise but the bed was so comfortable I almost missed it a few times! Things that are great about this hotel: - MODERN & CLEAN: Some of the hotels around the area looked great but had issues with insects/bugs entering the rooms but I didn't have that issue here. The marbled bathroom is just beautiful and the room itself was so clean.- SPACIOUS & COMFORTABLE: The room was a very generous size for a ""couple room"" with plenty of space to spread out your belongings and easily move around the rooms and relax on the couch. The bed and pillows were soooo comfortable it was like sleeping on a cloud. - FREE & FAST INTERNET:";5;0;0;0;1;1;1
Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;alekspacho;Really nice newly built hotelI in Uluwatu!;Nice to have this hotel in Uluwatu which is mainly a house/villa rental area. Not to many hotels are located around here. The hotel is new so it’s very fresh and clean. The rooms are big and have everything you need. Good breakfast and nice options for lunch & dinner. It’s not as big as other resorts in for example the Nusa Dua area but it makes the hotel have more charm and character. The location is good since it’s very easy to access restaurants and beaches in the whole Uluwatu area so if you prefer a hotel rather then renting a villa it’s very well situated!;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

The local area was easy to walk around. The offer shuttle bus to uluwatu temple and padang padang beach but you can definitely walk down to the beach (i suggest taking the bus first to know the route but it's very straight forward). There is Impossible beach which you have to walk down a path behind the hotel and down a cliff (not as difficult as it sounds) which is a lovely secluded area to relax. The rooms were spacious and very clean.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;voyeuristic;Gorgeous new 5 star resort in Uluwatu;The Location: It's up in the bukit area, about 15 min away from GWK area. The area is a bit remote, although there are still some cafes and restaurants nearby. It's near Padang2 beach. The neighbouring areas is still undeveloped, and there is a bit of a pig smell from the neighbouring farm. Although it's only evident when you're walking from the lobby towards our room on the right side of the resort. The Architecture Design: The resort is beautifully designed in a modern minimalist Asian style in the same vein as Alila Uluwatu. The resort is very luxurious, from the room, restaurant, pool, kids club and the spa, everything is superbly design and styled. Clean crisp lines, with beautiful combination of woods, granite and stones.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Labuan Sait Pecatu Bali;Radisson Blu Resort Bali Uluwatu;Julia F;Third stay in 6 months and going back!;We have just finished our third stay at Radisson Blu Uluwatu, since it opened this year! We keep coming back because it’s family friendly, yet stylish and immaculately well run and maintained. The architecture and interiors are tasteful minimally and the hotel is well located for those who want to surf the Bukit area (though a car or scooter would be handy for surfing and going out at night as there are many good restaurants in the area, it’s a long walk to the main road and Uluwatu taxis aren’t cheap). The resort is not only brand new but it’s an excellent quality build (which can be something of a rarity in Bali) and the rooms are luxuriously comfortable, with a 5 star quality fit out that you would normally only expect to find in a big city hotel.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

The room was big and spacious, the bed was comfortable and the balcony had just the right amount of privacy. The wifi was amazing, but the tv would lose reception fairly often (we were sick the first couple of days so lots of relaxing). The shower is amazing, the hose has so much pressure - it was sad to leave it! Strange large window looking out onto the walkway that you could see through, had the blind down the entire time. Good size bath with nice bath salts. Only major issue with the room was soundproofing!

We always love Nusa Ceningan but Blue Lagoon Avia makes it even better! Beautiful villa, excellent service, wonderful staff, good coffee with amazing view from KLYF Club - just a perfect getaway only less than an hour boat ride away from Bali. One thing that I love best about Blue Lagoon Avia is how the staff and manager Bapak Bagus always go above and beyond to give customers the best service. I happened to leave my wallet in the island and only realize it when I reached Sanur, but bapak Bagus made sure that I shouldn't worry. He managed to deliver my wallet back to Bali, just a kind gesture that blows my mind how his team always go above and beyond and always put customers first. So grateful for;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Nusa Ceningan Bali;Blue Lagon Avia Villas;Maggie;Excelent view;This is the most excelent view I ever seen in Nusa Ceningan. Still amaze the hotel build up in cliff and the view so magnificent of blue lagoon. Can't say any word for the view. If I can say some tips, please be flexible, I was disappointed about the shuttle service hour, they have schedule but please arrange the schedule close to boat schedule (gloria & d'camel fast boat) so the guest didn't wait so long in yellow bridge. Because some hotel in Lembongan do pick up also in harbour. Maybe its my bad experience but the electricity was suddenly off when 2am in the morning, and only my room. Thanks to Bagus he answer my call and turn on the electricity. I hope it never happens again to other guest. Definitely comeback again.;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

Nusa Ceningan Bali;Blue Lagon Avia Villas;Robert E;Amazing but beware;First and foremost the view from the public pool and restaurant is just stunning! It’s very peaceful and we loved our time there. We spent 4 days there and loved it. Here are the things to be aware of: 1.) They do an okay job cleaning the rooms. We had to request toilet paper, and also asked them to clean the room as sometimes all they did was make the bed. For instance found a dead crab in our pool. And had to remind them to toss our trash cans. 2.) They recommend the scooter rental and adventure company next door. DO NOT use this company for tours. Scooter prices are expensive compared to Bali but not much of a choice. We did the private tour and paid 3 million, and it was a total disaster and my partner almost got killed. 3.) Food is good for one or two meals but try;4;0;0;1;0;1;0

Nusa Ceningan Bali;Blue Lagon Avia Villas;Lubna;Best view in Lembongan;We stayed at Blue Lagoon Avia Villas for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon holiday and it had one of the best views we’ve seen of the Blue Lagoon of Lembongan. It is a beachfront resort. They do not have an actual beach to swim but with a bike or a shuttle, they can take you to the closest beaches around. The closest beach is Secret Point which was really nice with a swing and a hammock. Its a 5 minute walk. The hotel that looks upon Secret Point had really nice food! Bike rides could be dangerous if you do not know how to control the bike but are so fun and worth it. There is no internet connection when you leave the hotel so always keep a printed map with you. The reception can assist with that. For a sweet escape for a couple of days from Bali, this is the place to be.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Every detail at this place was meticulous, private pool in each of the rooms as well as a pool club overlooking one of the most spectacular views in the world. It is truly the bluest of lagoons and quite spectacular. We didn’t get bored of hanging out at the restaurant and enjoying the spectacular views. Must see!

The own beach club / restaurant is fine, not a 5 star restaurant, but all the dishes served are nicely prepared and taste good! The resort offers a free shuttle service and you can rent motor bikes in front of the resort (a must have if you are staying longer than one night). However, some suggestions from out side to improve the quality of your resort: get rid of the white umbrellas at the beach club (they look disgusting) and provide for towels for hotel guests at the beach club. Furthermore, install a shower at the beach;4;0;0;0;0;1;1

Staff were super attentive and English was well spoken which made communication super easy. I will definitely recommend to anyone staying on Nusa Lembongan / Ceningan;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

The private pool villas are as private as can be and incredibly relaxing. The staff is amazing. The food is great. It’s a little challenging to get to if it’s your first time to Nusa Ceningan but don’t let that stop you. Pack light, plan for transit time, and get ready to be blown away.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Nusa Ceningan Bali;Blue Lagon Avia Villas;Stian S.;Secret pearl!;We had an amazing three days at Blue Lagoon Avia Villas. We stayed in D4. Our private villa with pool had sun all day and it was so relaxing to stay there. Recommend bringing some form of music device, books and if your playful some pool floating stuff 🤘🏻 even though the villa was super chill, the view at the hotel pool and restaurant was breathtaking. Perfect place for couples who want a quiet get-away from overcrowded tourist destinations. Service was also great. Worth mentioning is that most of the staff had some troubles with the English language, but the hotel managers were flawless in their communication skills. Especially hotel manager Matthew was super helpful and just brightens up your day.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Nusa Ceningan Bali;Blue Lagon Avia Villas;Markdc8;Best view ever;Ceningan is a beautiful area but good accommodation is rare. However in Avia I found the facilities and service to be top class and well beyond my expectations. Having a pool in your villa makes it feel very luxury. And the cliff club they are building has the most amazing hypnotizing view I have ever experienced. The blue lagoon was amazing and the Avia restaurant on the cliff in front of it was the perfect place to enjoy it. Just spent hours enjoying the view. Was also surprised that Wifi was good too. I highly recommend this resort for travelers who want to see the raw beauty of nature but at the same time enjoy accommodations similar to a five star hotel.;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

The Blue Lagoon is hands down the most magnificent view points for all of lembongan and Ceningan, and we were very excited to know there would be a resort built overlooking the natural wonder. We were not disappointed. The villas were kept in the prime condition with beautiful bamboo, traditional local architecture, with plenty of places for us to just lie down and suck in all the beauties around us. The most magnificent thing is to watch the sunset of the blue lagoon from our resort. Aside from the natural beauties, the architecture, facilities, and service are the best in all the resorts we’ve stayed at on lembongan. What’s;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Sunshine15420489566;Magical, transformational and grounding experience;Ulaman has effectively became a nurturing home to me over the past week - it’s built and ran with love.

More importantly it’s a beautiful space for me to restore energy, reflecting about life in general. Staff is super friendly and really care about you. Owner Dino is such a cool person and the mastermind behind all of this (ask him what the architectural inspiration is!). I would recommend stay for at least 3-5 days to get the most out of it.

What’s even more amazing is the fact that it’s surrounded by rice field and river, and it has a waterfall inside the resort! So you can really imagine the breathtaking view and ambience you’re getting when you’re here. Our room was spacious, luxurious and equipped with complete amenities. We also had a private pool where we enjoyed a lovely Floating Breakfast in the morning. The staffs were friendly and very attentive to our needs.

That's why the resort area is very gree. The room area is also super cozy with wood and bamboo ornaments. The walls are unfinished concrete too. And the bathtub also uses wood! My room is called Batu Room, Private Pool Villa type with a pool depth of 1.4m. The room still uses AC which looks hidden because it is covered with wooden ornaments.

Indeed, that room has impressive details and fell in love with their bamboo architecture. We couldn’t even imagine bamboo possess that flexibility and keeping the room completely isolated from noise and insects. not to mention the sound of the waterfall that they’ve got close to our room and the restaurant. It is also literally right beside of the spa outdoor room, having that said, you might imagine this natural sound while having a massage. Btw, I strongly recommend the “lomi2 massage”, it was really good 🥰 Regarding the leisure activities , you can practice yoga on the top of the waterfall hanging from a balcony “yoga Shala”.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Elma;Beautifull eco retreat resort;Usually I always stay in a place with a modern building and interior. but this time I wanted to try something closer to nature and I chose to stay at Ulaman. When i first arrived at the lobby, we could see many bamboo buildings. so this place is all made of bamboo. honestly I really like it. when you enter the room, all the interiors are very nice, there are lots of stone and wood elements. the food here is also delicious + there is vegan food. there is a yoga place, swimming pool, massage place. everything is complete.

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Shaza Dzkl;Sustainability has never been so chic;Ulaman is truly an eco-retreat in design and principle. I’m thoroughly impressed with the architecture using bamboo and what I recently learnt from staying at Ulaman is the rammed earth walls – truly stunning to say the least. The room is quite spacious and really loving the wooden bathtub and the private pool. The service is good but can be better, although I’m thoroughly impressed by their F&B’s Eka and the resort manager Bandisa’s attentiveness, friendliness and knowledge of the hotel and the surrounding areas. The food is exceptional, especially when I learnt that the ingredients are organic and some vegetables are from their very own garden. They also make their own wine on site using their very own produce. This is a must-try! I had an amazing stay and would definitely;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Melisa O;Mini solo retreat;I had the privilege of visiting Ulaman Eco Retreat last week and it blew me away. I initially went as way to treat myself to a night of pampering and tranquility away from the hustle and bustle of Bali. I was also very curious to see what a modern day “Eco retreat” looks like these days as sustainability and creating a more regenerative world is very important to me. I am pleased to say that I was impressed with the attention to detail of the resort and the incredible service I received. From my welcome drink to the explanation of my room services to the smiles from all of the staff, I felt very cared for and welcomed as if it was my home. The entire structure is made from natural sources and you can see how they did not cut down many trees in the building of the project but;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Catalina VB;A very unique and unforgettable stay;We had spent 2 nights at the Ulaman retreat. Not only did they have the most comfy bed I have ever slept in but in general after our stay I was fully recharged. Waking up to nature sounds, and getting breakfast delivered wherever we wanted it to has been an amazing start into our days. We have tried a various number of dishes and they were all arranged beautifully and tasted incredible. The architecture of this place is one of a kind and I'm amazed by all the details and thoughts that have gone into this place when creating it! Walking through every path in the retreat you are surrounded by vibrant plants and the staff has been so more than kind, making us feel so welcomed. They always have a warming smile on their face and really cared about us and making our stay memorable! We;5;0;0;1;0;0;1

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Rochelle F;Hidden Jungle Paradise so close to Canggu;Wow, what can I say? This place is something else. I've stayed at a lot of places in Bali and this place really is something special. The design of the Ulaman is really out of this world, you feel like you've entered something out of avatar with the incredible bamboo structures, the treetop yoga shala and the pool that feel like a pristine blue lake. The food is amazing, so healthy and fresh and the staff are super warm and friendly. My favourite thing about this hotel is how it's even more stunning at night which is rare for an eco-resort like this. The lighting in the rooms and in the dining area and grounds at night feel like you are in fairy land. It's really just so special I can't wait to come back!;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Turns out he’s a chef, makes sense why the food is SO good. I highly recommend spending at least two days here to recharge and get creative.

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Gegfia;UNFORGATTABLE VACATION IN ULAMAN BALI , reviewed by @gegfia;At that time we stayed in the Ulaman Bali Suite room. The area is very large and very comfortable. I stay with my husband and children. Okay, I want to talk about the uniqueness of this eco bamboo resort. first the eco bamboo concept is unique, the design is extraordinary, the swimming pool is nice, the tropical land scape is very lush. And also the food is super delicious, ranging from traditional, western and oriental. Overall I really enjoyed this place. 9 out of 10 values ​​I gave. Recommended for you on vacation.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;ICGD;A real eco-retreat;I heard about Ulaman meeting Dino, the owner and founder, last year. He invited me to stay at the resort to experience the space for myself. I am skeptical about the use of the word 'eco' because it is splashed around so frequently with little adherence to the meaning of the word, and I was inspired to find that Ulaman really is committed to eco practices on a much deeper than superficial level. As-well as the thought and planning that has gone into the design and building of the space, using traditional techniques of earth walls and bamboo crafting, Dino is committed to powering the space using a water-turbine, as part of a phase 2 due to launch in July. This is not an easy task at all, and not for the faint-hearted! Many others have failed to get as far as Dino and his team in;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

The room and ammenities are very luxurious! I really had the best time staying 3 days 2 nights there, I will definitely come back again. I also like it because it is not too far from Seminyak or Canggu areas, although it is officially located in Tabanan. The rooms are clean, the bathroom are unique, the food is delicious.

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Tiara O;Best Holiday Ever;I had one of the best holiday experience I’ve ever had while staying at Ulaman Eco Retreat. First of all, the location is very unique. It is hidden in a tropical jungle in a beautiful village surrounded by rice-field called Kaba-Kaba in Tabanan. It may sound far but it’s actually just 10 - 15 minutes away from the busy area of Canggu! From the moment I stepped inside, I was completely fascinated with the amazing bamboo architecture that was visible everywhere in the resort. I stayed at the Cocoon Deluxe Suite which has a very unique design, similar to those Hobbit houses you see in the movies. It was spacious, had large windows and openings, and the bathroom had a stunning wooden bath tub that was to die for! I bathed in it like a Queen. It felt amazing. Ulaman also have;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

It has cold AC with a full set bathroom with a hot tub, comfortable king size bed, and a flatscreen tv to watch my Netflix. The road going here its quite small but when i got here, i was amazed and impressed with the bamboo architecture.. every corner are very picture worthy.

Even the bathtubs are made out of wood! Super clean, excellent service and wow the food, we LOVED it! When it comes to food, my girlfriend is usually extremely picky, but she loved everything they've served. Ulaman is a perfect getaway from the noisy Canggu or Seminyak. And if you love photography or creating content for social media, this is definitely a place to create outstanding pictures to share with family, friends and the world. Thank you for having us.

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Tanya;Truly Outstanding;From the moment we arrived at Ulaman our expression of joy and wonder never left us until we departed the next day. This is a truly unique and special experience. The attention to detail carried throughout the resort. The staff were fabulous, knowlagable, helpful and always made you feel like you are at home. The food was a delight and coming from a fussy vegetarian that says a lot. The cocktails were excellent, well mixed and something for everyone on the menu, Then there's the beds, ohhhhhhh I was disappointed when I had to get up, I could have slept for a week. Do your mind and body a treat and make this A MUST which I promise will be one of the most memorable stays you'll have in Bali if not the whole of Indonesia. Can't wait to retrun.;5;0;0;1;0;0;1

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Loren J;Wonderful Eco Gem;My wife and I spent two very lovely days and nights at Ulaman. First class accommodations throughout, from the perfectly appointed sleeping room with a private pool, serene bathroom with a hand made soaking tub, plenty of space for belongings, and an in-room espresso maker. Every meal was wonderfully prepared, was not typical Indonesian fare, and was fresh and made at the moment. The grounds are quiet, authentic and there's a waterfall on property. We enjoyed massages and other spa treatments, daily yoga in an elevated pagoda, and with the very strong wifi could also stay connected. We'll be returning to Ulaman Eco Resort again.;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

The stylish eco-resort is state-of-the-art and well integrated in its surrounding at a little river running through the estate. I especially enjoyed practicing yoga and meditating in the yoga shala above the river. The kitchen is recommended as well - you have to try their yummy vegan Rendang. If you are looking for a place for a luxury eco-retreat and if you like the combination of river, lushness, and not too far away from sand, beach and waves, Ulaman is definitely the place.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Surprisingly, it’s just 25-30 minutes from where I live in Kerobokan! I was in awe from the moment I set my foot in the premise. The architectural style is not like what I’ve seen anywhere else in Bali. When you walk in, you feel like you’re entering this exotic tribal nest in the middle of a luscious jungle forest. Absolutely dreamy and out of this world. The structures are all about beautifully-designed bamboo buildings with unique manta-shaped roofs. I had the pleasure of chatting with the owner, Dino, and he explained that they use sustainable raw materials like rammed earth and bamboo for the structures. Mindblowing.

My favorite is the property has its very on Waterfall with stunning floating leaf shala. Ulaman's wine is housed inside an actual cave inside the rock with beautiful carvings, now that's what you call a wine 'cave'. Best red wine in Bali here, organic, no chemicals, had more than a few glasses (it's so good it's hard to stop) and the next day, no hang over. That's the sign of good wine.

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Three Sixty Guides;Sustainable and so sexy.;I loved my stay at Ulaman Eco retreat. Made completely of sustainable bamboo and locally sourced teak, the design is modern and futuristic. Originally it was planned as a private villa and it feels like a home. The hospitality is generous and even though there is an emphasis on health and wellness, (the yoga treehouse is incredible), there is no stuffiness or judgement, you come as you are. The first phase is done. I stayed in a suite in the main building, there are also pretty self-contained pool villas scattered throughout the property. Phase 2 is just beginning and it looks amazing with a day spa, pool, restaurant and more private villas being built around a man-made lake.

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Sophie BOURON;A VERY SPECIAL PLACE!;The architecture of this place is just WONDERFUL. It is a pleasure for your eyes to look at each detail which are design with intention and harmony. The fresco sculpted in the rock is magnificent! It represents scenes from the Kama Sutra and was specially made by local artisans. The yoga ballet is like hanging in the air and it is a beautiful invitation to let go the earth to reach a new dimension. You will hear also the song of the flow of river which is near the swimming pool aera. You might go to discover the beauty of this place!;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;EditorSophie;The perfect eco wellness centre for a yoga retreat!;"Bali is a hot destination, and choosing where to retreat amongst the hundreds of offerings can be a big task! What we loved about Ulaman is that we found in one place everything we like; sustainable architecture, a yoga studio, a spa, luxurious (and super clean!) rooms, and a farm to table cuisine. The staff is very accomodating and gracious and discreet at the same time. The sound of the river is calming, and the fact that you get all of this peaceful vibe a mere 30 minutes from either Ubud or Canggu makes it a perfect retreat choice to escape when you wish to for some adventurous activities or a plain shopping spree.";5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Ivory G;Ulaman Eco Retreat, The One and Only Paradise For Healing Your Soul;I really felt extraordinary when I first visited this place. My curiosity immediately led me to explore this place. Starting from buildings made of bamboo, but it looks so magnificent and very unique. besides that the combination of nature and luxury makes this place look so special. I do like buildings that theme natural, traditional and unique, but this place has added value where the luxury side looks very clear, ranging from furniture, food and beverage offerings, bamboo architecture that is packaged so extraordinary. This place is also very contemporary, there are lots of photo spots for you who like photography, especially my favorite is the Main Villa, which is so uniquely designed and extraordinary, we feel we are on a cruise ship with views of green nature, rivers,;5;1;0;0;0;0;0

Tabanan Bali;Ulaman Eco Retreat;Nikki h;Nature-lux at its finest!;This place is really something special. An absolute haven of beauty and tranquility, the ambience and architecture is literally breathtaking on arrival. Although its an eco resort and constructed in part from bamboo it still feels very luxury and not rustic in any way yet you are immersed in nature. The hypnotic sound of the water flowing from the waterfall and along the Ulaman river becomes the soundtrack to your stay. The rooms are beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable. Make sure you have a massage at the spa, the therapists are next-level! We brought our kids who are a little older and loved swimming in the river. The service and food have so much attention to detail it really makes for an all round wonderful getaway. Highly recommended!;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

I honestly cannot recommend Sun Suko enough! As a single female travelling to Bali by myself I was extremely nervous but this was quickly relieved once I arrived at Sun Suko. Anja & her team have made this retreat a home away from home. The attention to detail is incredible & the staff go above & beyond to ensure that you are comfortable & being taken care of from the moment you arrive (or like me - from the moment you step out of the airport). A great location if you want to be away from the crazy city life but still has plenty in terms of bars, restaurants, ATMs, supermarkets, the beach, etc. that are a 20 minute walk from Sun Suko or a 5 min drive. Food in Sun Suko was so delicious! I ate in;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Each room has been thoughtfully designed and furnished with a different theme in mind making them fun and quirky. Rooms were large with extremely comfortable beds and all had outdoor verandas from which to enjoy the spectacular views of the mountains and jungle.

I especially love the bathroom and the in room decoration. The pool is absolutely stunning and had a great temperature. Perfect spot for sunbathing. If you prefer the beach its just a couple minute walk away and you could even rent a bike. Perfect spot for snorkelling and diving as well. The food here is amazing. Probably some of the best food I had in Bali. I love how environmentally friendly this hotel is as well. They don‘t even charge for drinking water.

From the time we booked ro the time we left Anja and her staff could not have been more helpful. Whether it was organising a driver... for a very early pickup from the airport, or sorting out a scooter for me to use. It was also easy to arrange early breakfast, very useful as I needed to be out early on a couple of days. The pool was great, the room was clean and spacious, and the staff were attentive, professional and friendly. Highly recommend! I'll definitely be back next time I visit Pemuteran!;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Buleleng Bali;Sun Suko Boutique Retreat;Thomas P;Unforgetable moments;"The entire resort is excactly delivering what it's called *boutique retreat"". OH NOOOOO, it's much more than words can describe. Still I give it a try. Hight standard accomodation with a lovely pool area in the center, first class architecture desing on the houses with its interiors and garden. Clean, tidy and very well maintained. Privacy pure. Most probably the best beds on the island. A lovely open yoga-shala with sunrise and mountain view with mats are a further plus, besides the offered inhouse Yoga & SPA services. The day starts always with a rich breakfast in the Sun Suk restaurant with a most relaxing atmosphere . The entire Sun Suk staff are always handy and delivering a great host service on helping you to organize unforgetable moments. We will be coming back";5;0;0;1;1;1;0

Buleleng Bali;Sun Suko Boutique Retreat;leanne c;Blown away by this hidden gem;Sun Suko is such a special place. We were so blown away that we cancelled our plans to go elsewhere and visited twice on our month long trip around Bali. The resort itself is stunning. Not a detail has been overlooked, the rooms are themed, from lovers to dragons all of the fine details are beautiful including the art that surrounds this place to match. Everywhere you look the views and vibrancy take hold and make you feel like you are immersed in the culture and beauty of Bali. We loved the home cooking at the resort with all meals made from scratch using local ingredients. It takes a bit longer to prepare but is totally worth it. During our stay the staff could not do enough for us, they were so welcoming, friendly and amazing with our children. We will miss them and feel;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

The hotel is beautifully designed with wonderful gardens for the children to explore, the food is fresh tasty and varied to suit anyone’s taste. The hotel staff have been excellent at providing food and drinks non stop for our large family and making us feel welcome and part of the Sun Suko family. The hotel is owned by a Swiss lady who lives on the island, although we did not meet in person she was available on the phone to assist with anything from advice on day trips to helping us look for property ourselves in the area. Thanks again for an excellent holiday! We will be back.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Buleleng Bali;Sun Suko Boutique Retreat;Travelglorious;Super stylish and peaceful spot!;We loved this place. It was super stylish and set amongst tranquil surroundings down a quiet and pretty lane. Lovely pool area and a great breakfast. Spotlessly clean with friendly, welcoming staff and we only wished we could have stayed longer. My only recommendation would be the provision of a couple of bikes. It is only a twenty minute round trip to the nearby strip of restaurants and perhaps 15/20 minutes one way to the beach, but in the heat, a bike would have been a great inclusion. Would definitely recommend over the nearby resorts. It has class. Thank you for a great stay.;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

All the local people say hello as you walk to and fro the town. The villas are around a lovely pool and were very comfy with high quality finish, fixtures and fittings. I loved the outside bathroom with a mountain view. The staff are fantastic - from the cleaners to the co-owner (a lovely Swiss lady who has taught the kitchen to make tayberry jam and dark rye bread). Breakfasts are generous and extremely tasty.

Buleleng Bali;Sun Suko Boutique Retreat;meilaiswan;Perfect venue for a yoga retreat;"I recently hosted a week-long yoga retreat at Sun Suko for a group of 14, and we could not have had a more wonderful experience. From communication and organisation with Anja, the owner; our reception, support and exceptional care from Kathrin, the manager; the professionalism, warmth and delicious cooking of the local staff, and the gorgeous rooms, pool and yoga shala - it was the perfect retreat experience from start to finish! They catered for all our needs with so much care and joy. I can't recommend Sun Suko highly enough as a place to host yoga retreats or just to go for a beautiful and relaxing Bali getaway. Thank you so much, will definitely be back!";5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Buleleng Bali;Sun Suko Boutique Retreat;Natrisha B;Beautiful retreat in a hidden part of Bali;Anja and her team of beautiful women have created a peaceful paradise for anyone looking to relax and unwind in a quiet setting with a gorgeous view.

Buleleng Bali;Sun Suko Boutique Retreat;Laura R;Perfect!;I stayed at Sun Suko for a long weekend in April with my husband and would thoroughly recommend it. The resort/hotel is beautiful and in a quiet, scenic location. We loved our room - but they all look fantastic and so tastefully designed and decorated. I really enjoyed that it was a small place with only 8 rooms/suites, so they can pay extra special attention to each guest. Katherine was so considerate in all her interactions with us and helped us organize the activities we were interested in - like snorkelling and viewing the waterfalls on the way back to the airport. The breakfast was delicious and also the dinner the cooked for us too (probably the best food we had in Permuteran).;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Your choice if you don't want to venture out at night. We found the staff very friendly and helpful.It is a pleasant 15 min walk to beach down a rural lane . The warung on the right at the end of the lane serves great cheap food.Some bikes for use/hire of guests would be a good idea .Highly recommended place to stay if you want to be in a more secluded setting.The owner Anja was in easy contact by whatsapp and is lovely and very helpful.She has a little;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Every room has an unique interior and is handpicked. We truly loved the Staff! They are so welcoming. I loved to do my own Yoga practice in the small and beautiful Yoga Pavilion in the morning and to relax in the nice pool in the afternoon sun.Yoga Classes are available on request and are truly recharging.

Our room was in the second floor with great views over the surrounding mountains and a large private terrace. The heavy wooden furniture with Balinese-style carvings in the room is just gorgeous. On arrival we could choose ourselves our room out of two availble rooms on the second floor which were both very beautiful. Also the breakfast is extremly good, with a selection of fresh fruits, pancakes, bread, eggs, yoghurt etc. The hotel is located a little bit outside of the main touristic area of Permuteran, so it takes around 15 min on foot to reach the beach.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

We had breakfast included and it was so so yummy, especially the dark bread and vegan smoothie bowl! They also do evening meals which are fantastic too, the papaya salad was my highlight! I used the yoga shala and the instructor was wonderful - very much recommend. The owner Anja also will go out of her way to help organise any outings and recommend places to go. We stayed mainly in the area as we wanted to relax and the beach (10mins walk) had the most fabulous snorkelling reef which kept us going back daily!;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Buleleng Bali;Sun Suko Boutique Retreat;Bibubs;Heaven on Earth with a appriciated personal touch;We stayed 5 nights in San Suko retreat and it was one of our nicest stays during our 6 months holidays in Asia. It is a great value for money and you'll find the perfect accommodation for your budget. The cook prepares every dish you like with great care and competence. We only ate plants and whole foods and I finished my plates faster then ever. This is a small place so you should not fear to sneak sometimes in the kitchen and communicate with the chef what you like to eat, since there is no real menu. Our days started with 80 min Yoga every day - according to our needs. Followed by a delicious breakfast, swimming and reading, healthy lunch and sometimes it even felt hard to leave the hotel to walk to the beach (10 min).

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;R S;Lovely hotel, but !;Just returned from 12 days at this hotel, it’s a beautiful property, well manicured gardens. However, the hotel is in need of attention after 36 years of being open. The bathrooms need upgraded, as do the towels & bedding which were discoloured. We twice had to get maintenance to come up due to water leaking from a vent. The window boxes were full of weeds and the balcony could have done with a power wash. My bed was cracked on the base also. The spa also needs a make over, mirrors were old and tarnished. Blue & white plastic sun loungers looked cheap. All in all good holiday, but very expensive now with the 21% service charge & government tax.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Nahsrik;Traditional and authentic hospitality;This is a very special resort which while traditional in its design has a lot of character and spirit which we felt added to the Balinese experience. The hotel is older than 30 years with the rooms and room amenities limited. However, the facilities and surrounding gardens and open spaces make it a special resort which we enjoyed with our 7 year old son and two 70+ adults. We took the all inclusive package with Luxury Escapes and was a great decision.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Lombok Friendly;A perfect place to experience the true Beauty of Bali;"I have visited this place countless times and still find myself amazed by everything. For me, this is just the right place to experience the real Bali. Once you enter the main gate of the ITDC Bali complex, you know you'll be experiencing the magical Bali in any of the hotels in this area. But Nusa Dua Beach Hotel remains our pick for a holiday in Nusa Dua. Not only this hotel is among the most prestigious in the area but is more about the details of hospitality applied; from unique and beautiful architectural design to strong Balinese influence in the buildings, nice and warm smiles from the staff, super clean hotel room, marvelous breakfast and a lot of Balinese experiences like the Kecak dance performed in one of their restaurants.";5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Darren J;As Relaxing as Ever;Just wrapped up a week in a Lagoon Access Palace Club room. This was our second visit to this resort. We really couldn't fault it last time so had no reason to look anywhere else. Was a great week and we were happy to put some money back into Bali. The Good - Lagoon Rooms are amazing. The quiet lagoon pool is open to lagoon Rooms only so you usually have your own private pool. There's no secret about what you get here, the rooms are spacious, feature dark timbers and huge beds. The rest of the resort is now open and pretty much back to normal. Bars, restaurants are all good to go. The Less Good - Ok, the hard part. The rooms are starting to need a refresh. They're still really nice, but just looking a bit tired.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

The club is peaceful for breakfast, afternoon tea & evening cocktails. The room was lovely and spacious and we had a special treat on arrival for our honeymoon. The pool areas are good. The beach is beautiful. The restaurants are good - the only thing that would have made it even better is if the Asian restaurant was open every night otherwise it leaves you with one restaurant to eat in. We really enjoyed our stay and would like to thank everyone at the hotel as we made lots of memories we will remember! Thank you!;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Matthias K;Wonderful stay with warm and welcoming staff;"We were fortunate enough to discover the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa on a recent trip to Bali. The hotel is a sponsor and partner in Pencils for Kids, an organization that brought us to the island to help distribute school supplies to children in need all over the island. The staff itself plays a big part in the program, helping to organize the packing and distribution of backpacks for the kids. But beyond that feel-good culture, we simply had a nice stay. The hotel has a strong sense of place; unlike some of its neighbors, there is little doubt that one is in Bali as opposed to some other tropical getaway. That is also reflected in the rooms, which are very comfortable and well laid out. Indeed, the various different closets, drawers, cabinets, etc.";5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Sandy T;Nusa Dua Beach Resort & Spa;We have stayed at this resort 3 times and will come back. We have spent 2 wonderful weeks this time. The rooms are spacious, with balconies overlooking beautiful gardens, pool or ocean. The management and staff are friendly and helpful rooms are well kept with service daily. Our days start with a workout at the gym, sauna, spa & plunge pool then a wide breakfast choice in a spacious garden setting with pond of water lillies, fish & lizards habitating. Then to one of the pools. Activities include yoga, aerobics, balinese dancing or just relaxing at pool or beach. Walk along beach strip are magical.

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Tammy B;Fabulous holiday;We recently stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel for 9 nights and it was the most amazing holiday we have ever had. What an absolutely beautiful hotel! The beach is lovely and the people are fantastic. The food was great and the hotel was spotlessly clean. I could go on forever mentioning the positives. I have only rated this hotel with 4, rather than 5, purely because we felt that the bathrooms could do with updating. Although clean, they are past their best and tired looking in;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

I was amazed by the very well-maintained hotel building, the staff was very friendly, kind, and responsive to guests. The hotel rooms are very comfortable with complete facilities. The restaurant provides very delicious food. Many local animals such as lizards, squirrels, birds, and geese are allowed to roam and interact with guests. Guests can also enjoy swimming on the beach with white sand and calm clear water. I will definitely come back again for the next trip and enjoy a very comfortable staycation at the Nusa Dua beach hotel. Thank you..;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

The hotel was in a lovely location literally on the beach with large grounds. Our room was ok but a little dark and the layout made wardrobe access difficult. It was regularly clean and linen changed daily. We couldn’t use the balcony much due to the squirrels who roam freely. Meals were good with a large choice and plenty of restaurants to choose from, they were expensive but the Bali connection shopping centre was a short walk along the seafront with cheaper meals if necessary.

Breakfast is very varied and tasty, freshly squeezed juices, upon request, can cook what you need (we were cooked oatmeal). In general, the resort of Nusa Dua was struck by its cleanliness and safety. Everywhere security and video surveillance. Beach .. it's something. The beach itself is clean, comfortable sun loungers, but the sea .. is a disaster.;4;0;0;0;1;1;1
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Val B;A beautiful hotel!;The best thing about this hotel is the staff and the location. It is a beautiful hotel with wonderful gardens but it’s a little tired being over 30 years old and is in need of a refurbishment. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable with excellent facilities. The swimming pools sun terraces and beach front were excellent. The hotel and its grounds were spotlessly clean and well maintained. Our one complaint was the price of food and drinks, they were well over the top. We think that by over charging by so much the hotel was shooting itself in the foot. We along with many other guests staying here went elsewhere to eat and drink where prices were far more realistic!;4;1;0;0;1;1;0

Boards for hire down southern end. Nusa Dua was very safe and secure. Great place if you want to get away from Kuta. Resort had more of a Fiji feel. The only downside we could think of (which is very minimal) the prices are on the expensive side for Bali. Very similar to what you would pay in Australia within the resort. You do need to get a taxi or driver if you want to go out and get into the thick of traditional Bali or to find cheaper meals and shopping.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Some of the best hotels and restaurants are closely located near this hotel and one should take a walk on the beach to experience those as well. Some of them have beautiful ambience and they are open to all guests. Nusa dua beach resort also has 3 good restaurants overlooking the sea. We tried the International one and it was not bad. Had limited vegetarian menu though and absolutely no vegan dishes. They should work on incorporating more variety in their menu. Their breakfast buffet though offered variety and was good. Even though the overall property was beautiful, our room was just about ok. But overall we had a good stay.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Anne-Lise L;Beautiful grounds, right on the beach;Loved the Balinese feel of this hotel. Lots or sculptures, temples and beautiful gardens. We did the complimentary cultural tour and learnt that it was the first resort built in nusa dua 37 years ago. The rooms and the pool area are showing their age. Although the beds and pillow were comfy, the bathroom was small and outdated. We stayed in a connecting room on the ground floor and were a little concerned by the security of the French doors, only held by a small latch. The big plus is that the hotel is right on the beach and you can easily walk to Bali collection on the path along the beach. You do get to see some much more modern resorts along the way.;4;0;1;0;1;0;1
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Danny D;Bali holidays;The resort is at an isolated Nusa Dua area. Although it’s probably the nicest part of Bali but it take at least 20-30 min to walk to shops restaurants nearby if you want to explore the local area. The foods at the resort are pretty good. In our surprise we had very good fish and chips room order service. It’s a very safe and quiet area if you want to stay away from Bali traffic.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Nazeatsout;Great value for money;We enjoyed very much our 5 days at Melia Bali. A very green and beautiful hotel. Comfy rooms, very good breakfast buffet and well-appointed restaurants.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Corie N;Luxurious end to our Bali holiday;"Beautiful room, cold aircon; amazing beach, great pool, perfect service. A relaxing bit of luxury to end our Bali trip. The pillows are to die for, and the shower and toilet large enough for a small family. Thank you so much";5;0;0;0;1;0;1
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;curiousbee2019;Great Hotel for a relaxing holiday.;We picked Nusa Dua as we wanted a quiet location to relax. The hotel is older but very Balinese and still feels luxurious. Breakfast buffet had a wide array of Eastern and Western foods. Prices of food and drinks in the restaurants were similar to Australia once you add taxes, so not the place for a cheap holiday with a family, however the food was good. Closest cheaper options are at Bali Collection mall which is accessible by free shuttle or 20 min walk. Because we booked for family of 4 we were offered adjoining rooms which was great.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;aprbecks23;Paradise;What I love most is the privacy of the beach, and the safety. The room is cozy. The size is just right. Only disappointing is, I can't watch the sunset. But all in all, it's an amazing experience.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;valdowling;Made by the fab staff;Room always clean and tidy. Air con continually left running 24 hours per day, causing a damp feeing in the bed sheets.

Plenty of wildlife especially at breakfast restaurant;4;0;1;0;1;1;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Mikelain;Lovely restful location;We enjoyed all of the facilities that we used at the Hotel. The location was perfect. Lovely to walk on the path adjacent to the ocean, passing through other hotel properties. The pools were clean, always plenty of lounges available, but probably wouldn't be enough during peak time. The Hotel was only 50% occupancy at the time. There were a lot more lounges available on the beach. Easy walk to Bali Connections, but there is a shuttle every hr throughout the day (except 12noon and 5pm), and also return (takes less that 5 minutes).;4;0;1;0;0;1;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;500orsolya;A very Balinese hotel;Very Balinese architecture, abundant breakfast, nice pools Little bit outdated, rooms and hotel might need some renovation, white plastic sunbeds on the beach are really retro style, less cosy beachside facilities compared to the neighboring hotels;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;21Sue35;A Older Balinese Hotel.;The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel is an older hotel and very Balinese in style. The rooms are of a good size but have an old feel.

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;paolocampobasso;Trip to Bali;The room was big enough and comfortable but the humidity was very high and we asked a dehumidifier. Even our clean clothes in the wardrobe were always humid. I think the room in upper floor could have better ventilation. Moreover in the beach the white plastic beds very close to each other do not comply with 5 stars hotel requirements.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Nerissa L;Restful stay.;The hotel had a feeling of grandeur to it. The grounds are well-kept and lush. The rooms are comfortable and clean. I liked the slippers provided for in the room. The breakfast buffet had outstanding selections, and quite enjoyable as it is near a lagoon with koi. The Tamarind is a perfect place to spend the afternoon in and watch the sunset over drinks. The food wasn't bad either.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;yuzu;Good beach. Helpful staff.;Not very new decoration. A little bit dark at night even I opened all the lights in my room.

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Mandyegg2k;40th anniversary visit;The hotel is typically Balinese and beautiful. I think making it more modern would ruin it. The rooms are spacious with a walk in shower, hairdryer, shower gels etc and 2 bottles of water per day. You can fill your own bottles up downstairs. There is a minibar again expensive. Most importantly to me was I heard no noise whatsoever from adjoining rooms, which is a rare thing in more modern hotels.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

The room was spacious and clean, the beds very comfy although we had 2 single beds and would have preferred 2 doubles or queens.

Beach was nice, good selection of avail loungers. We did not use the pool, but it looked very nice. We only ate at Friday night's seafood buffet & fire dance show. It was expensive, but well worth it. We took the free shuttle to the Bali Collection shopping center 10 minutes away everyday for dinner, which had much more dinning options for a much better price. Highly recommended hotel.;5;1;1;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Robert S;Beautiful but ageing;Stayed here for 8 days on a luxury escapes deal that included a premium room, all inclusive meals & daily free flow drinks from 3-6. The rooms were spacious, classically Balinese & kept to a pretty good cleanliness but they did come across as a bit old, especially with all the new resorts & upgrades & renovations that seem to be occurring all over Bali. As is the norm many things within the hotel were on the pricey side (eg massages), luckily our package included 2 massages each but we chose to go out of the hotel once the;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Julie Ross;Beautiful hotel with impressive entrance!;We visited recently for my husband and brother-in-law's 60th birthday - yes they are twins! The hotel looked after us extremely well, with a pleasant welcome. The rooms (we stayed in Palace Club Suites) were spacious and the balcony large. The silver service breakfast was very good. Particularly, Gin and Eka. Thank you. The beach is very nice, although quite shallow as there is a sandy reef which is exposed when the tide is out. The beach is kept very clean and tidy, the sunbeds are comfortable and also service for drinks as and when. The lobby is spacious and has many beautiful artworks and two pond with fish.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Karl S;Holiday;A beautifully set hotel in amazing grounds and right on the beach. A great base though to explore the south of Bali and not too far from Sanur to ferry to Nusa Penida. Restaurants and pool bars are great. The hotel standard rooms are called ‘deluxe’ but are a bit tired. They have bed bathroom and balcony but not huge so I’d advise an upgrade if your needing space.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Mistyboy30;Lovely Balinese style hotel;My wife and I stayed here with our two friends for five days. The rooms are really spacious with super king beds and feather pillows that my wife and friend wanted to take home because they were so comfy! The rooms have a safe, fridge, mini bar, hairdryer and a spacious balcony. Because the hotel grounds are quite large you never get the feeling that it is full of people and I can’t imagine that you would ever struggle for a bed by one of the pools. Similarly the private beach never seemed overcrowded. There was a varied choice at breakfast and over the five days we didn’t get fed up of the food.;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Leshaggis;Authentic and excellent;Had 6 nights here with a Club Room package.

The room was spacious and well equipped with complimentary water. Breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails were served on a private terrace overlooking gardens. This added to the price but worth it for the tranquil setting and quality of the food. The sports facilities were excellent - good gym, 2 Astro tennis courts, 2 squash courts and a games floor.

The facilities were fantastic, a stunning clean beach and gorgeous sea! Great value food and drink for a quality 5 star hotel. If you want cheap food and drink there are a few Warungs (little beach cafes half a mile up the beach). There is a lively and busy road full of restaurants and spas just a short 5 minute cab ride (costs 20000rp around £1.30) in Benoa. We went to Lotus Spa opposite Hotel Nicco. Amazing value at around 80000rp for a 1 hour massage.;5;1;1;0;1;0;1

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Constardpudding;Palace Club worth it!;Stayed here for 4 nights in a Palace Club room. Breakfast and afternoon tea were very delicious with many options to choose from. Rooms were spacious and clean. Best perk of booking this room was that it was directly connected to the pool so I can go for a morning or evening swim easily. The shower water is not hot, just lukewarm and it uses filtered ocean water. For a hot shower or bath using tap water, you have to use the bathtub. My hair became so much softer after switching to using the bathtub water instead!;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Robyn S;Awesome ambience - peaceful;If you are looking for a holiday where you can relax and enjoy yourself, then the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa is the place to go to. From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were well looked after. The ambience is beautiful. The layout of the hotel gives you a real sense of spaciousness. You have a choice of pools or the beach to swim in. Tennis courts and well equipped gym. Our room was ground floor fairly close to the pool, but not close enough to be disturbed by any noise. The room was spotlessly clean.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Berna68;Nice grounds, great pools nice decor, food and drinks expensive;We had a five day stay with a few hiccups most let down by very poor check in. I was not happy with how we were treated and after some deliberation approached and asked for a manager who apologised and without my prompt or expectations upgraded our rooms which was very much appreciated The resort sits among 6 or so close resorts and around 20 minutes walk along the beach front to Bali collection I suggest you use Bali collections for food and drinks to have at the Hotel as in house purchases very expensive.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Helen;Beautiful relaxing hotel;We found everything to be perfect. The beds were amazing, the rooms spacious with lots of storage but the bathroom was a little tired.

Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel;4;0;0;0;1;0;1
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Passenger08647852734;Relaxation plus;A fantastic resort which was full of architecture and character. Peaceful and tranquil. A true Balinese experience. Plenty of food and drink options for our “all inclusive” package. The room was always clean and tidy with a comfortable bed and we appreciated the larger room. This resort is one of the originals in Nusa Dua. There has been lovely upgrades throughout, however the bathroom could have done with a facelift.;4;0;0;0;1;1;1

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Helen M;Wow;The hotel is beautiful, the service is attentive but unobtrusive and the location is spectacular. We spent 7 nights there and tried all three restaurants which offered a variety of cuisines. The rooms are spacious, the beds heavenly and the balcony views peaceful and serene. The only slight negative is that our bathroom needed an upgrade. It was clean but tired! All in all though, we would definitely recommend.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;RGVW;Very pleasant stay;I stayed the first two days of my time in Bali in this hotel. The hotel is big and already somewhat older, but to my experience I did not encounter any problems or flaws. I had a Palace club room . A bit expensive but value for money. The service was excellent, some of the staf remembered me from a previous visit in 2012. This is not the place to discover Bali, but if you want to start or end your holiday with a few days of pampering, I can recommend this hotel;5;1;0;1;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Boris G;One of the best hotels in Bali;We stayed in this hotel many times and each time it has been getting better though it was very good even many years ago. It has been renovated, rooms look very nice, very comfortable beds and pillows, no smell or dampness, air conditioner in the room was quiet and very efficient. Very clean throughout resort, beachfront location, lots of sunbeds at the beach and near pools, 3 restaurants with delicious food, particularly Maguro bistro. This year with a new pass we were able to walk to Bali collection and to other resorts with pleasure.;5;0;1;0;1;1;1
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Jaawid N;Beautiful Balinese styled resort, friendly staff, and wide variety of cuisines;We stayed at Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and Spa for 5 nights. We were truly amazed by the beauty of the Balinese architecture echoed across the resort - it was almost like a tourist attraction. The room was clean, spacious, and had a great view of the back garden from the balcony. But, we were really blown away by the Balinese food we had at the Raja’s Balinese Cuisine restaurant. We highly recommend this resort to anyone interested in staying the Nusa Dua;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Carol T;Beautiful resort, room a little disappointing;"We are currently staying here for a week as part of an Emirates holiday.The position of the hotel is wonderful; the grounds are beautiful, the pool areas are excellent and the buffet breakfast is delicious. We are having a wonderful time, but wish we had upgraded as the standard room we are in is not 5 star standard.We are on the first floor so have a terrace opening on to a lovely garden.There is a path leading past it, and for some reason we have no net curtains, although surrounding rooms have.This means we have to keep the shutters fastened more often than we would like.The bathroom is basic and some of the furniture chipped and stained.The bed is comfortable and the room is well maintained.";4;0;0;0;1;0;1
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;tim tam;Accommodation;For leisure, better to pay a little bit more for the Lagoon Room to have more enjoyment. Because you can access to a pool (only for those Lagoon Rooms) and you can have a sun-bath in your own balcony without leaving from your room. Most importantly, you can swim at any time just you want!;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Ange Singleton;Amazing Pool Terrace Rooms & Day Spa;I stay in many hotels around the world each year and needed a few quiet days to revive. This was amazing. the rooms are HUGE and a very large terrece with steps straight into a lagoon style pool. these are at the back facing the sunset part of the hotel so no kids and very quiet. These rooms also include business class lounge access free and included al a cart breakfast in private setting only for these guests so no buffet breakfast hall to fight with, however that is amazing too may i add. Now this hotel is spectacular traditional Bali and the Day spa is worth every moment. this also has a huge private relax pool , full tennis courts, 2 indoor squash courts fully air condition and bikes on site to use.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;Ysyans;Beautiful resort with some room for improvement.;My 3 nights stay at Nusa Dua Beach hotel was very enjoyable.

So lovely to see the many squirrels enjoying the gardens too- such a delight each morning seeing them chasing each other on my balcony! I really appreciate the upgrade from Deluxe to Premier, the room however was a bit tired. I initially had few issues with the room that which fell below standard, the management term swiftly and efficiently resolved all issues for me which was nice.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;JC00000;Service makes this hotel good;This was our first visit to Bali and we researched and read up on a lot of hotels before booking Nusa Dua. The hotel is in a good location from the airport, just 15-20 mins but not too close to be bothered with aircraft noise. The hotel has most of the facilities you need but is definite tired in places. The rooms do have air con but were not very cool. We had booked the standard (deluxe) room with an extra bed.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Nusa Dua Bali;Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa;gerry_mavin;Quiet and clean;Very quiet hotel though fairly expensive drinks and meals for Bali so always best maybe to take a free bus or taxi to bali collection or just out of complex. Rooms are spacious and clean though air con little noisy and they missed refilling the mini bar 50% week which was as maybe a good thing . Nusa Dua is up market in terms of location as a result is very secure but in some respects very tourist good choice for a week quiet break .;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Renee M;An Absolutely Incredible Stay;I do not have enough good things to stay about Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort.

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Aiman Kimi;Luxury on a cliff;"Great room with superb Indian Ocean view surrounding. The hotel is located on a cliff looking down ""Impossible Beach"". We love the vibes and hotel design which blend to its environment. For the room, we stayed in Ocean View suite and the outdoor Jacuzzi bathtub was a plus point for us to enjoy the sunset view while chilling. The room also provided in-room audio system where we can connect our own device and play and dance to our own favourite tune , which my kids and I enjoyed doing it during our stay.";5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Muhamad Hanif Asaari;One of the Most Stunning View of Uluwatu;We would like say thank you to Anantara Uluwatu. This place really paying attention to small details that we really appreciate. From the greeting cards, warm services to complimentary outdoor photo session, Anantara Uluwatu does distinguished itself from others in Bali. The room was so spacious and the cliff view was so breathtaking. we don't have the opportunity to stroll at their impossible beach but it was satisfying enough just be brought down the cliff by an elevator. Few things to improve maybe on the room itself as the tired look was quite evident in many part of the room. Maybe it is just time for refurbishment to keep up with the brand name. Othe rthan that, our only regrets;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Samantha_and_Noah;Highly recommend;We stayed here for a few days in July 2022. We would highly recommend. The location is incredible, up on the cliffs directly overlooking the beach. You can access the beach via an elevator at the hotel and there is a very short shuttle bus to Pedang Pedang beach. The pool area is absolutely beautiful and the sunsets are money. The room was also incredibly spacious and well appointed. One small note: we found the hotel services such as food, drinks and laundry were quite expensive (e.g. AUD 9.5 for a bottle of sparkling water). However, if the hotel prices get too much, there are nice restaurants, groceries and other shops within very easy walking distance. Overall, we were incredibly impressed and would highly;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Nupur;Good room view but service can improve;We stayed in the Ocean Front private pool at Anantara Uluwattu. The room was spacious and the private pool and jacuzzi were great amenities to have. The ocean view especially during sunset was amazing. The hotel has an elevator that goes to the private beach area but if you are not a surfer, it might not be something very interesting since Uluwattu beaches have high waves. Room amenities were good but the house keeping services used to take a lot of time. In room dining arrives quickly but cleaning staff used to be reminded again sometimes. Also the complementary photoshoot only includes 2 free images and the hotel asks you to pay for the rest.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Helda F;Best holiday ever!;Whenever we go to Bali we always stay at Anantara Uluwatu. Not only because of the view but the room is so spacious so it gives room to move especially if you comes with family like me. The sofa is humongous , that what my son said when he entered the room . 2 kids even can sleep there. This time We spent 6 days at the resort and we really like it. My family having a great time we enjoyed the swimming pool so much with beautiful view of the ocean while enjoying the pizza from Botol Biru Bar & Grill , it is the best one.. Also The spa was amazing. I spent 4 hours there. We are definitely be back soon;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Main bedroom was perfect, very spacious included with a Jacuzzi Tub and they providing you with bubble bath soap as well. You can also get floating breakfast (with add charge) if you want.

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Anthony S;Beautiful view of the sea;The room was great, we stayed at villa number 603, amazing view of the sea. Price-wise ideal, perfect for couples or families who enjoy exercising since walking up and down a whole bunch of stairs is kind of a have to (no escalator or travelator, the elevator doesn't do much help if you choose to stay in the villas). Would've been the perfect staycation destination if not for the invasive hoard of ulat-gagak (But then again, these guys are everywhere in Uluwatu). 4/5 is a fair judgment of the place.;4;1;0;0;1;0;0

Room is spacious, breakfast is perfect, jazucci is amazing with the view of sunset, pool is big enough, and access to the beach is easy however it’s a pity we went there 10minutes before the elevator closed as it is closed quite early around 6pm which is the sunset time so we only spent a little time at the beach.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

We also have our own small garden, pool, and living room, which is very convenient for a family. However, the stairs are unbelievable.

The stairs are something you must fight for, there are lots and lots stairs like to everywhere haha. The main pool is big and infinity type facing the ocean. And there is private beach too.

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Teguh;A very pleasant relax hotel in Uluwatu;A cliffside, exclusive hotel in coastline of Uluwatu with serene atmosphere, amazing views to the ocean and spacious rooms fit for family or couple staycations. Hotel is most suitable for a laid-back, slow-paced and quiet retreat-like experience. I'd recommend at least spending two full days at the hotel to enjoy everything the hotel has to offer, as there are lots to see and do and it'd be the best way to get the most value out of the hotel. Rooms are also very comfortable and spacious, complete with very comfortable beddings as well. It is definitely a good idea to enjoy them as long as you can while you stay here.;5;1;0;0;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Simone Marine;Great time at the cliff-resort!;We were greeted with a welcoming sound of the gong stroke. Going up the stairs to the lobby was quite a workout but when arrived at the top, we're wow-ed by the cozy high-ceiling open-air atmosphere, the earthy wooden furniture, the amazing view and the hospitality of smiling staff. Room was huge with large seats in the living room. Bathroom also huge with his-hers sinks. Balcony was spacey with jacuzzi looking out the ocean. The downside of the room was when we used the shower, water would always flow out from under the glassdoor and made a puddle in front of shower door (may be this only happen in my room?) Breakfast was amazing! The view was bomb! Looking stright to the ocean. Love the simple yet delicious a la carte menu. The beach was that INCREDIBLE crystal-clear;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

One of the best in Bali;We stayed at Anantara Uluwatu for 3 nights in July and liked it so much that we came back in August for another 3 nights. The location is dramatic on the cliffs of Uluwatu with views that go on forever. An elevator takes guests down to the beach at low tide. The suite rooms are large and very comfortable, and the bathtub on the balcony is perfect with a glass of wine and the sound of the waves. The breakfast is varied with Indonesian and western dishes, and all are very good. We really hope to be back at Anantara in September.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;AdigunaKusuma;Stunning clifftop resort yet need a bit improvement;This resort is nestled in the edge of Pecatu. We actually booked a suite with private pool but since our friends booked a 3-bedroom villa, we had chance to experience more. The suite room is nicely decorated, layout is lovely, however it has quite less privacy in the pool area as we could easily see guests next door balcony and pool.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Fly S;True heaven on earth;Where shall I start? The extraordinary, super attentive staff, the Australian GM who greeted me on arrival or the ocean view suite with breathtaking views on the waves and surfers. There is a large Jacuzzi on the balcony and a shower with both rain shower and two hand-held shower heads.My room had twin beds and a huuuuge couch which would sleep another two. Every afternoon they tidy up your room and serve complimentary refreshments and a fruit platter. My friend arrived the next day and received a new fruit platter The hotel itself was located straight on Impossible beach. You only have access to the beach by a lift operated by the hotel staff. The extremely friendly people will inform you whether the tide is low or high.You can walk to Padang2 beach and wade a bit to Bingin;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;traci_rae;Beautiful place to stay;We stayed at Anantara for 5 nights. We deliberately chose a resort away from the typical hustle & bustle of Bali to just relax and recharge in a resort with great facilities. We had a pool access room. Apart from the visit from monkeys, we felt like we were the only people there. This hotel is so peaceful. The food at both restaurants was excellent and breakfast was amazing. Housekeeping was excellent and our room was spotless on arrival and kept that way through the duration. Room was extremely well appointed with coffee machine and a few other little touches that make a difference. Bedding was wonderful and pillows were great. There were a few reno's in progress, but these did not hinder our stay and we hardly noticed them at all. Spa was incredible. One of the most beautiful;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Ricky T;Amazing experience;Everything is perfect. Nice people, service, food and environment.I had stayed in the hotel for 2 nights in the Ocean Front Pool Suite. The room is amazing. Stuning view from the private pool looking at the Indian Ocean. We had private dinner at the Viewpoint and the staff had prepared us with an amazing decoration. The food tastes perfectly! Although there was heavy rain and thunderstorm at night (We even saw a tornado in the sea!) , the staff had immediately escorted us to the chapel for the dinner. (The chapel offers even better scenery than the Viewpoint!). Much appreciated for the backup plan. All in all we are very amazed by everything this hotel had offered. Me and my wife enjoyed very much.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;CT021;Really good, but could be better;We stayed here for 5 nights (Luxury Escapes package). It is a lovely hotel with lots of positives and a few negatives. Our room on the 5th floor was very spacious with a stunning view of the ocean. The bathroom was beautiful too. The Bose Bluetooth sound system and the pod coffee machine was great. My only 2 negatives were that fresh milk in the fridge would be much better and what I would expect in a hotel like this. The other small issue was that with the restaurant upstairs, there were the constant sound of footsteps from early morning until late at night. The hotel spa is fantastic - I had 2 amazing massages here and it’s a beautiful and relaxing space. The hotel pool is lovely too - also with the amazing view.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Jackie L;Wonderful Honeymoon Experience;My husband and I came to Bali to celebrate our honeymoon, and what an incredible time we had staying at Anantara. We booked the Bali Honeymoon Oceanfront Suite package, which included a pool and hot tub on the balcony of our room. The room was very large and the balcony area was fantastic and also included two lounge chairs for laying out. We had arrived around 10pm, and noticed the room was off of the main pool.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Ankit M;Wonderful Stay;It was our honeymoon trip and we had a great time. Room was neat and clean as expected from the resort of this level. Indian food options will not be there and even the veg options were very less, so anyone planning the stay should plan accordingly. View from this resort is just mindblowing as it sits right on the edge of the cliff;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Fitzroytraveller;nice hotel, lovely location, opportunity for improvement;This was our first visit to Uluwatu - if you are looking for a beach break this is definitely the area to come. The hotel has beach access, not a great swimming beach but adequate, only however accessible at low tide. There are many other local beach options accessible by foot or cab We stayed in an ocean view suite with a Jacuzzi on the balcony. Lovely! There are many positives about the hotel: - lovely, huge rooms, well appointed - lovely large bathroom, excellent shower - really good food in all the restaurants - fantastic buffet breakfast - very good location and wonderful views.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Michael;Relaxed and Wonderful;We recently stayed at this hotel. Great location. So close to cafes and restaurants ( we had a scooter ). Had a massage at the spa and would have to say it was the best I have had to date. Rooms were spacious with a huge couch ( would fit 5 people ). Breakfast up stairs with a wonderful view over looking the resort and the ocean. Highly recommend for your stay in Uluwatu even if it does have 1000 stairs haha. Absolute Bliss. Even caught a proposal from our balcony down on the little look out point.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;christianap123;For the price, not up to resort standards.;For the amount money we pay the quality of the hotel is not up to our expectations, breakfasts experience and menu selection is not great as well. The room felt old, a huge room with a nice view of the sea tho. Toilet flush broken several times.;2;1;0;0;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;winnietan2;WT;This is such a beautiful resort. Although the location is quite far from famous attractions, the hotel alone has great facilities and services.

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Mktravels27;Beautiful resort;We stayed at a two bedroom villa with a private pool for 2 nights. The resort is beautiful and our villa is gorgeous!

The hotel located in the cliff of uluwatu but if you want to go down to the beach they also provided us with an elevator. Such an unforgetable moment, look forward to back again for sure. we would like to say thank you to the staff of anantara, especially;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;cristinamunozbr;Most amazing room, view, breakfast, everything!;From the moment you driver pulls up into the amazing entrance of the hotel to the sad farewell with everyone at the establishment everything is absolutely over the top! The room was just a dream, big bed, private pool, jacuzzi, great pressure at the shower, a huge living room and bose speakers (what my husband enjoyed the most) enough to have your own party. We barely left the room, but when we did we went to the pool, which is instragram perfect and service at the pool bar was great!;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Luiza;Beautiful hotel, a bit isolated. Checkin process/staff has to improve;The Hotel is beautiful with a view from the cliff, infinite pool and many well cared flowers and plants. I completely recommend it. Bed and shower are very comfortable, room with view to the ocean is very big. Breakfast is a plus. Painpoints: The hotel is very isolated, you should walk 15-20min to get to the main road in the middle of nowhere in the fields, very difficult as it is so hot and sunny (later I was told they drop you there if they have availability.;4;0;1;0;1;0;1
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Liz W;Amazing views!;Stayed 3 nights at Anantara after being in Legian for a week. A great place to wind down before heading home. The views from our room and from the pool were amazing. You could watch the surf for hours and never get bored. Our room was unbelievably good. Very spacious and comfortable. Lots of steps in this resort, so must be prepared for this. Many steps down to the pool. Also a bit far to walk to surrounding restaurants so need to get transport. A motor bike or scooter would be ideal. But could also just stay at the resort and be perfectly happy, no need to go any where.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Mel n;Luxury escape;We stayed here for 3 nights in an ocean front suite booked through luxury escapes. I have to say this hotel is amazing they have thought of everything. From the daily room fruit platter to the nightly turn down service. We had 2 dinner included in our deal which were both great and lots to chose from. Breakfast has a large selection of food plus a soup station and the smoothie/juices were yummy. Our deal had massages the spa was beautiful and one of the best massages I have had. The infinity pool was lovely and watching the surfer everyday was soo relaxing.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

View from the room is amazing, overlooking the ocean. Unfortunately, there was an extensive renovation taking place during our visit, so it was rather noisy and dusty.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Chris_Jacobs43;Great Hotel for Beach View;We recently stayed 10 nights for our 20th anniversary and had a great time. We booked one of the rooms with its own infinity pool and loved it! It was so nice to take a morning, afternoon and evening swim whenever we weren't spending time in the amazing main pool. Our room #642 was on the top level and the most pool private (since we like to go in naked). Since the hotel is on a cliff (on both sides), this place has a lot of stairs. We discovered (not told) that there's a ramp on the left side of the hotel you can take to avoid so many stairs getting from our room to/from the pool. We were very disappointed that the lounge overlooking the ocean was closed for renovation(we like to have some drinks and mingle with other guests during our vacations).;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;Jill;Beautiful!;The Anantara sits on the cliff of Impossibles Beach in Uluwatu. I didn't know that the entirety of Uluwatu is essentially on a cliff. Anantara has an elevator that takes you directly to the sand, which most hotels do not in the area. The staff was incredibly friendly, helpful, and welcoming. We got upgraded to an ocean view suite, which was absolutely amazing. I highly recommend getting a room as close to the ocean as possible. Ours had a jacuzzi tub on the balcony. The chicken sandwich by the pool is truly the best I've ever had. The breakfast included in the price of the room was also the best I've ever had. I would love to go back! Highly recommend!;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;ChicagoCityGal;Fantastic Resort with Great Ameneties and Even Better Hospitality;We stayed for five nights in August 2019. Our room was spacious and clean with a beautiful view of the ocean. We slept with the patio door open so we could hear the waves. There are three restaurants on site, all great. Try the Sop Ikan, a local soup in the 360 restaurant that is fantastic! The breakfast buffet is amazing and the bacon is actually crispy (non US locations seem to prefer softer bacon, not sure why). The staff is friendly and extremely helpful throughout the resort. They helped us to book a last minute excursion, and got my surfer husband back and forth to the surf spots he wanted to try. My son loved the pool and the daily activities (different each day: yoga, arts/crafts, etc.) they have for guests. We loved it and would definitely stay there again.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Pecatu Bali;Anantara Uluwatu Bali Resort;NICHOLAS T;Stunning location;Sitting on the cliff top, high above the beautiful ocean of Ulu Watu, the Anantata offers simply incredible views from all rooms and various vantage points around the hotel. The room we stayed in was well sized, with a nice living room area and bedroom combined, large bathroom and very large balcony including bath tub/jacuzzi. Splash restaurant offers Australian inspired/barbecue food and good drinks deals. 360 restaurant, where a very good buffet breakfast is served, offers stunning views and nice Indonesian cuisine in the evening. The only complaint would be that the gym is slightly small and the resort is slightly dated in parts.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;The Apurva Kempinski;Storyteller761921;Family Holidays;I was lucky enough to stay at the Apurva Kempinski in Bali with my sister, son and niece and it was a wonderful experience. The house keeping staff Pirata and Putri were especially lovely and attended to all our needs in room 6253. They could not do enough for us. We would also like to thank the staff at the Reef Club who were kind and attentive. We did have a couple of little issues and my sister Samantha posted an honest review about this but this was quickly rectified and they were very nice about it. The management couldn’t do enough to make us feel compensated for this. All in all it’s a beautiful hotel second to none and I hope we will back again soon. Very sad to be leaving this tropical paradise. Definitely 5 stars.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Nusa Dua Bali;The Apurva Kempinski;BenTChristieK;Amazing Stay! The Apurva Exceeded All Expectations.;We have just returned from our stay at the Apurva Kempinski. We stayed for 3 nights in the Cliff Private Pool Ocean Suite. We requested for a room with more sunshine, and we got exactly what we wanted, a room with wonderful sunshine all day. Our first impression when we arrived, was how incredibly impressive the lobby was! We were just standing there with our mouths wide open. Hands down, the most impressive lobby we've ever been in. Our private pool suite, was absolutely amazing, floor to ceiling windows, and waking up to the sun rising and the perfect views from the room, will be locked in our memories for a long time. We don't impress easily, and we have some very good hotels from Maldives to Phuket. But this place really took it to a whole new level....and then some.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

The facilities were very nice. We stayed in the junior suite with the pool with the garden view and it was very enjoyable. Private pool was exactly what we needed sometimes. SPA experience was just amazing. So good and high quality service. We liked some restaurants. In particular Chinese and Japanese. Very high quality and excellent taste/service. We did not like Coral restaurant too much - it was clearly overpriced. The pool with the fish is nice (you sit under the pool with the glass walls and see the fish swimming by), but dishes in the tasting menu were just too much complicated. Simple taste and simple dishes would work better in our opinion. Reef (grill) restaurant was also;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Nusa Dua Bali;The Apurva Kempinski;Karen K;Great hotel but disappointed by lack of beach access;This hotel has top-class amenities and exemplary service, but: 1. The beach directly behind the hotel is unsuitable for walking and is inaccessible to the main Nusa Dua hotel precinct (except for those hotels immediately adjacent). This was a dealbreaker because we chose Nusa Dua only because of its superior beach (to Seminyak). 2. The hotel can be difficult to navigate/access depending on room location. 3. Four outdoor-marquee weddings in 10 days caused intrusive construction activity, noise around the pool and at Reef Cafe and obstruction of ocean view from our suite.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

This property is simply fabulous from the architecture, facilities and service all round. They provide all sorts of things that will occupy your time here without even need to go out. My kids truly enjoyed the kiddie pool with their water splash and slides. Not forgetting the kids club. They just had fun time throughout. Dining was superb. Tried Koral and Beach Reef and both were wonderful. Only downside for improvement was towel supplies at the pool may come short at times, which is minor to us. Buggy service frequency can be better especially during peak December period. Had to wait for while to get our buggy heading back to lobby from Zone 6. And it was raining most of the time when we were there, so more frequent service;5;0;0;0;0;0;0

Breakfast is on Kapur Sirih restaurant, very huge restaurant that I'm sure able to accommodate all hotel guests in the same time :) . breakfast menu also taste very good, unlike typical hotel's breakfast which usually taste plain. but please add more type of fruit into your menu.

Stayed 3 nights in family room suite which consist of two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a living room. One adult can sleep on the sofa.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;fransiska7;Pleasent stay, great infinity pool, nice breakfast!;We stayed at Atanaya Hotel during 06-10 april 2019 (4 days). We pick executive room (twin bed). We asked them to join the bed so it could be wider and more safe due to us have a 2-year-old toddler. Atanaya did what we asked for. Cons: 1. The check in process took a bit long (30minutes). 2. The towel weren't ready yet when we checked in. It took 2 hours to deliver it to our room. 3. The tap in the wash basin was trouble, it only flew hot water only. But the technicians mend it when we complained. 4. Some cocroaches attacked when we got back to room from dinner. PROS: 1. The room quite wide, clean, and comfortable with city view. 2. Enough facility inside our room: refrigerator, coffee/tea maker, sofa, writing table, drawer, cupboard, bathroom amenities. 3. AC worked well 4. TV…;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;ValentyD;Great pool!;Great pool with warm water, perfect value for the money.

The food was good and tasty, there are many other stalls and resturants near by. The infinity pool could do with a revamp it seemed a bit dated but in the evening with lights and and music it sure came to life. The weather was hot so we did spend the day time dipping in and out of the pool.;4;0;1;1;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Jo P;Flying visit;My partner and I stayed at the hotel on a room only basis for four nights before a cruise. The hotel is clean and tidy and the staff are very helpful. The hotel is situated on a main road which is noisy 24hrs a day so if you get a room in the road side of the hotel be prepared for a noisy night! We ate in the restraunt once. The food was okay, but there isn't a load of choice so you may not want to eat there several times. The hotel is about a 30 min walk to the main tourist area and beach. It's quite a straight forward walk, but the hotel offer a free mini bus shuttle at 10am, but you have to ask the reception. They don't appear to advertise this service. All in all the hotel is fine for a short stay, not sure I'd want to stay thete for a couple of weeks though.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Adri;Beyond good for most of the aspects;"I think this hotel is quite new; the room interior has got a modern touch which I like a lot. Getting to the imperatives: 1. The air conditioner works well to cope with Bali's air in dry season 2. Full body mirror which is so practical and enhances the modern look as well 3. Lightning is a bit dimmed 4. Excellent cleanliness of the room, the beds, and the bathroom 5. The shower and the water heater system works stably, very well 6. Love the toilet: flush rush, no fuss left *sorry for the lame pun*. Although the bidet water flow is kinda weak but still acceptable 7. Beyond average breakfast. Menus are a bit varied but having it for 2 days, I'd have rather sought Balinese authentic foods outside like roasted pig, betutu chicken, etc. 8. I requested a laundry service for my tee and…";5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;angesouthport;Lovely friendly staff but next to very busy road.;The rooms were very spacious and bed was very comfy. The staff could no do enough to make our stay enjoyable. The only downside to this hotel is its location. This is the only reason why we though our stay in Bali was a bit of a let down. It would have been better next to the beach and bars. I am glad though that the staff put the clocks the right way round!!! There is however lots of things to see and do in Bali. If it’s a cheaper option you require I would recommend but bare in mind you would require a 30-40 minute walk everyday to beach or a taxi costing just under a fiver.;4;0;0;0;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Grace M;Holiday in Bali;We stayed at this hotel for 7 days. The service is excellent and the staff couldn't do enough to make your stay as pleasurable as possible.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;INK;Cheap and Cozy;I stayed here twice and always satisfied with the service and the room. it's simple and cozy. Only one thing that made me really disappointed at that time. I went to the swimming pool in the rooftop and wanna have a dinner there. I asked the guy what time is the last order and if it is okay or not to have dinner until 11pm. He said it's okay. I went there around 10pm anyway. but when the food come and we just have a one bite, suddenly they turn off all the lamps and it is still 10.30pm. well of course I'm pissed off, because its not comfy to eat in the dark, duh? I complained to the reception staff and they said sorry. In my second coming to this place, it's not happened anymore. so its good :) Well, overall, Atanaya is a nice place to stay.

We had our dinners mostly in the hotel and local Indonesian food we had was good quality and value for money again. cheers. I will recommend this to everyone. Vikas;5;1;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Voyce71;Wonderful staff & pool;Clean rooms. Bed was extremely comfortable. Staff very friendly & helpful. Roof top pool is a great facility, however, there is very little shade, hence pool side gets very hot to walk on in bare feet. Great entertainment several nights a week at pool side bar. Bathroom would be bit difficult for someone large. Shower was great. Additional breakfast choice would be nice, not great choice for Westoners. Our bedroom floor need replacing as several laminate boards were quite badly chipped. Overall the brilliant staff more than made up for any minor annoyances. Although this hotel is fronted by a busy road, it didn't interfere with sleep. Good restaurants, shops & banks nearby.;4;0;0;1;0;1;1

Located along sunset road boulevard, just next to krisna the biggest handycraft shop in Bali the hotel is far from hustle bustle of kuta beach and night club, but if you want to get there you can reach it in 20 minutes driving (around 3km i guess). Restaurant very easy to access, there are many choices at the front of the Hotel, and even the hotel restaurant served delicious food. Swimming pool also big with many lounge chairs, and located at the rooftop. And the wall was made from glass!!!!!! Breakfast was delicious with decent choice and we also have lunch at the restaurant. Our recommendation was definitely the oxtail soup!!! And their summer cooler drink We fall in love with…;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Vonny C;Good View Rooftop Pool;So, i've been stay in this hotel for 4days with my family. And really, the staff is so nice with the local tourist (very rarely find a place that the staff friendly with local tourist. they always more nice with tourist from another country) or with the another tourist. Service is so good, and the seafood fried rice! You all have to try if you stay in Atanaya Hotel, sooo delicious! and about rooftop pool, that's good and the view is amazing too, especially when you swim at day late in the afternoon. And, for me, the location is also strategic, because Krisna, gift shop from Bali, is right beside this hotel. Overall, i really recommended this hotel for you guys :);4;0;1;1;0;0;0

The room was clean and always maintained throughout the day and the appliances such as kettle and mini fridge was very well maintained We had a free breakfast buffet every morning which was always rotated around, with different Indonesian meals and typical breakfast foods (pancakes, omelettes, porridge, cereal etc). The staff were friendly, greeting us very morning and when i returned to hotel. I was alwasy greeted by my name which i thought was pleasant. Not too far from Kuta beach, a 20mnts walk or around 30.000 thousands rupiah by taxi. RooftopPool was relaxing with shade umbrellas and beach chairs, and nice lounge music.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Sussy20;Couldn't fault this hotel;We only stayed here for 4 days wished it was longer. Hotel was clean and the stay were excellent so friendly. The hotel is on a main road and we never ventured out on foot as we had an amazing tour guide for whole of our trip which took as around whole island for a brilliant cost. Hotel has a convenience store and macdonalds near by if needed. We just ate local food everywhere very nice. Breakfast is plentiful lots to choose from however juices and water were always warm and not cold. Tea coffee, water and toiletries supplied in rooms. Highlight has to be the roof top pool was great for a day or nighttime swim as open to 11pm. Live music and djs up on roof bar by pool some nights too. Would highly recommend this hotel.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Trippppie;Hotel with Infinity Pool;Excellent stay and exceptional experience. It is a wonderful property with almost all the facilities than one expects when traveling. The highlight has to be their rooftop (kind of infinity [but not really infinity]) pool. The staff is very friendly and cooperative. The hotel is excellently located. You are very close to the Kuta Square but not really in the middle of all the hustle and bustle. The breakfast buffet is pretty reasonable as well and room service met our expectations as well. We ordered Indonesian food and were not disappointed. One con was that the Hotel does not charge anything to your room. Room service, the bar and all other facilities have to be paid in cash, which was very surprising to us. We would have preferred if all facilities were charged to our room…;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Perfect for a night time swim or a margarita during the day. Most of the time we found we have the pool to ourselves! The staff were so friendly, helped us with anything we needed - calling us taxis and drivers, preparing fruit lunch boxes to take sightseeing, even being at reception when we got back at 3am. Always with a smile, nothing was an issue. 24 hour security as well. Just be aware, this place is that it isn't in the main drag, takes about 5-10mins by taxi to get into central…;5;1;1;1;1;0;0

Next to the hotel is Krisna, it makes me easier to go shopping. The hotel itself is small, but the the room is very spacious, modern minimalist and clean. The bathroom also nice and clean. Rooftop swimming pool is just in the right size. I like the wifi in the hotel, it is free and very fast. Lobby is too small. Dining room is just so so. Hotel would not accept any order during breakfast time, it seems they do not have enough F&B resources. I didn't buy breakfast that time, and the hotel insist me to buy breakfast…;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

The rooftop pool is amazing, especially with music played, so you can relax at night. Breakfast is great with choices which are different every day. But the wifi may be a bit slow (this seems to be the problem of most places in Bali? I'm not sure). And I'm not sure why there are always some finished dishes at the corner.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

We loved going there for a morning swim and it was even more amazing at night as it just had such a great atmosphere. Staff were lovely, the food was decent but the room could have been a bit cleaner. It is located on a main road so it is easy to hail down a taxi.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Ita S;Clean, nice and warm;I've stayed here during new year, we can saw many fireworks from the rooftop. Hotel location side by side with Krisna, which mean so great for us, indonesian traveler to buy merchandise for our relative. The room was great, clean and comfy. Even though the breakfast sometimes a bit salty.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Sheyla A;Very pleasant;My staying here was very pleasant. Helpful staff, clean room. It's just pretty difficult to find nearest restaurant at walking-distance late at night. But I will stay here again for my next holiday in Bali.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;NipunAmbastha;Beautiful Hotel with good surrounding;"Hotel is one of the gem, it's located near to market but less noisy. Rooms are well spacious and mainted, you will surely have a pleasant sleep. What to say about rooftop swimming pool, amazing stuff. Its surprisingly beautiful, grab a beer ""BinTang"" local Bali beer and enjoy time in pool seeing around the area. Food is good, we have been taking breakfast and couple of time Dinner and lunch, its goood and taste like home. If you want to try different dishes do go out and try couple of resturants across the road e.g. Furama I am enjoying my stay here and have enjoyed each and every moment with my gal. What I am liking about Bali is people are very Friendly. Next stop is Ubud.";5;0;1;0;1;0;1

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;manonspot;Bit out of the way;On the bright side Hotel staff were a joy as they smiled constantly and tried their best to help you,the dark side is they don't always get it right.I contacted hotel before I arrived to arrange a taxi to pick me up at airport and was told no problem,when we got there no one was waiting and as we didn't want to walk away spent half an hour looking at other drivers boards to no avail.got airport taxi to hotel,showed the girl receptionist e-mail confirming pick-up and was told we would get upgraded to executive room next day as apology,Girl was not on duty next couple of days so that didn't happen either.The problem with the hotel is location,you need a taxi to go anywhere as kuta and Seminyak are to far to walk but the taxis are cheap if you can get a metered one to put his meter…;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;nischaybm;Excellent;We stayed in Atanaya Hotel during our visit to Bali on Nov 2015. Hotel is well maintained, with nice staff. Rooftop swimming pool is an added attraction.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;fwarddd;comfy hotel;stayed at Atanaya from friends recommendation last weekend. artistik decoration, clean room, helpful staff, strategic location (ATMs, a famous souvenir shop, mini market and restaurants are nearby), cool pool and the view is very nice. the thing is, in my humble opinion, the towel kinda old and the WiFi need some maintenance.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Wisnu_Sakti;Nice hotel;I stayed for two night last week with my little daughter. In overall Atanaya is my recommendation hotel for you who has looking for clean room, friendly staff and strategic location. Beside the hotel is one of biggest shopping/souvenir center. Breakfast menu is good enough very Indonesian taste, a bit different with mostly hotel at Bali with plain / western style. The pool is only for teenager up no kids pool but the view is very nice. However, the same with other travelers opinion, I think towel need to replace with the new one. Also for hotel amenities is very limited. Besides, TV channel for kids program also limited. Wi Fi is not working properly and need to improved.;4;0;1;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Rhey;Enjoy Bali;My room view, the hotel is very nice with swimming pool and other facilities, roof top, lounge, very nice..

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;fbradfield1;Convenient stay in Kuta with everything you need;We stayed here for two nights in August. Driver picked us up at the airport and delivered us to the hotel so that was nice. The hotel does have bag service as well so if you are exhausted as we were, you can come in and crash immediately. The rooms and bathrooms are really clean and comfortable. Everything functioned well in our room, so no issues there. The hotel restaurant is nice and not a bad price either. Just be aware it's a bit slow, as with most other places in Bali as well, if you are tight on time. The staff helped me rent a motorbike, make calls, find shopping, and gave directions to places to wanted to go, and so on. We were very thankful since this was our first day in Bali and we were trying to get settled in. The only issue we encountered was with the WIFI. They…;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

Not really expecting that from a budget hotel... Room is clean and quite spacious, and i like to dine in their restaurant too, they have good food with affordable price, not hotel price which make me happy =) Always my favorite destination for long stay business trip... Thanks Atanaya staff for making my stay comfortable;5;1;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Maikel1989;great value for money;The hotel is a bit away from the beach area but the service is amazing, the breakfast is splendid and it cost a fraction of the price of one of the resorts by the beach. it's located on a convenient location to visit different parts of the island. the rooms are very comfortable and the rooftop swimming pool is amazing;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Matthew R;Great Hotel & Delicious Breakfast;I stayed here with my wife for a week. I book for honeymoon setup, roses are very fragrant and fresh, my wife love it so much. The hotel is in an ideal location, easy access cheap taxi to Kuta area. Skypool so amazing, best view and good for sunbath. Never missed the breakfast, breakfast was delicious, ranging from local to western cuisine. Really want to come back again. Thanks atanaya for the great stay and hospitality. I love Atanaya Hotel.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;BazTan;Good & Clean Hotel;This hotel has all the basic needs for a good stay, but I get a room which really close to the main road and get a lot of noise at night so I requested to change room and the receptionist agreed to change our room to a quieter room. Shower is good with all the basic toiletries. Breakfast is average. Location wise, close to Krishna (in fact NEXT to it) which you can get a lot of cheap souvenirs. But is not a strategic place as you can't really walk to anywhere, not the Kuta Beach definitely. But they do provide shuttle service to Kuta Beach, just ask the receptionist for it.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Riarchie;Very clean hotel and strategic;First when i came to Hotel, staffs really helpfull and kind,room really classic and very clean,on the night we enjoyed the night sky on Roof Top pool what a best view!! the breakfast are so variety, and a strategic Hotel,i can get everything what i need!! i really want to come back agaaiinnnnn!

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;niningwidjaja;Great Clean Hotel;staying at this hotel for 5 nights, during my business trip to bali great friendly staff, their room is very clean and spacious. Clean room is very important for me, since im quite alergic to dirty and dusty place. When i came there, the deluxe room was fully booked so they upgraded me to executive room. Breakfast was delicious, ranging from local to western cuisine. the best thing about this hotel is their pool located at rooftop so when you swim, you wont get disturb by people passing around looking at you i will be back to this hotel for sure;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;ankur a;Nice and quite hotel;Stayed in the hotel for 3 days. Rooms were neat and clean and staff were courteous. The roof top pool is faboulous. Breakfast could have been better and can include something for vegetarian. Overall a nice hotel.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;cHUmmYyyyyyy;very good hotel, near khrisna, located at main road, clean and spacious room;"the room is such lovely and spacious, but i get one room near elevator, so mainly hallway is so busy also at this peak season many kids running around :( (this hotel kind of family hotel). and often i can hear the pipe flowing waters when i was asleep ;( shower pressure is so good, although the interior shower room is so-so, should adjust its tile while this hotel will be so recommended to other travellers. unlike other hotels i stayed recently, breakfast here is tasty and i was satisfied, big dining room so not worry didnt get table. you should try their nice pool at rooftop! i certainly will come back to this hotel again in the future with better room location :)";5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Neil W;Lovely Pool Area;We stayed here using a good deal that we found online for £17. The price jumped to double that when we requested an extra night, however. I'm not sure I would stay here for the 'proper' price. The rooftop pool area is lovely and it's location means the sun shines unobstructed on it from sunrise to sunset. The room is clean and spacious, and the beds are large and comfortable. The staff are a bit bubble headed, though. The snooker table in the lobby had solids and stripes missing and instead of apologising they just laughed and said, 'yes, that's the way it is!' The food is limited, mediocre, and overpriced, and there are no cocktails to be bought at the place. A mojito would go a long way poolside!;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Erick S;Great Hotel;I stayed here with my wife for 4 nights. First I read the reviews from tripadvisor and others, and finally chose Atanaya for our hotel in Bali. The staff are friendly, helpful. The room is nice, but my room is quite noisy because my room is located next to main road. The breakfast is good. Mix of western and indonesian food. For guys, you can ask for razor if you need. Location : I like it, strategic, and next to Krisna, Bali souvenirs shop.;4;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;alfini;Payless for remarkable one;This is a small hotel, with friendly and helpfull staff. The room is new with modern and minimalis style, not too spacious but comfort and clean. But it' s not near with hustle-bustle of Kuta area,need about 15 to get there, may you need to hire taxi or rent car/ motor cycle. The Shopping place for gift and handy craft just a step from this place...it was the most for everyone in our group;4;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Abokz29;Fantastic 3 stars!! Or i must say 4stars?;"Staff are all friendly and helpful!!! The moment i arrive every staff do thair job really well!!! I am amazed how they do their job by keeping their guest happy and have a great experiences! I did have a wierd things happen on my booking which is double booked. Not sure how it happened but the head who incharge that time Mr Rahman is a very great guy. He managed everything well and i hope he is. :) He corrected the double booking and canceled the doubled booking. Auch a relief and so i could atleastenjoy my holiday in bali peacefully. The room are spacious! All amenities are good enough. Although i got several ""stranger"" dinging my door bell and no one was there, i guess it was kids. Doing pranks since my room was exactly infront of the elevator. May i suggest few things,…";5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Natalia F;Excellent Hotel with cheap price;we went to Bali for honeymoon and stayed 2 days in Atanaya. Hotel was so excellent, staff was very friendly, polite and helpful. Hotel has beautiful roof top pool and bar. Room is so clean, wifi connection is good, easy to get many things from Bali since hotel location is just next to Krisna. Hotel location is close to everywhere, only 10 minutes to Kuta, legian area. Breakfast was very good also.;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Tj P;Good 3-star hotel;Pros: - the hotel is non smoking. - has a rooftop bar and pool - buffet breakfast is good - the room I stayed is rm 510. Clean room, comfy bed and smells good. - elevator smells like fruits. Hehe. - room price is affordable (Includes buffet breakfast) - easy to locate. Just along jl sunset rd beside krisna. Cons: - The shower door emits a glass breaking sound whenever I try to close it. - the bath towels look old. Needs change. - the entrance is blocked by several cars. It isn't easy to pass through these parked cars without accidentally bumping on them. - rooftop pool doesn't seem nice during the evening. The lights are dim. And the floor is slippery.;4;0;0;0;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Ashutosh M;Above Expectation;The staff is very polite. Room is very clean tidy and cozy. Great service. Bad points.. Slow Internet Plus: room rate and service.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;erico_trip;A good hotel with great price;We stayed for 3 nights. The room is very clean, and when we checked-in, they upgraded our room to a bigger room, many thank's for the compliment. AirCon was good and we had a cozy room, bathroom was good, and we had nice warm water at the shower. The only minor complaint was the sound of traffic at night, a little bit loud for me. Other than that, it was definitely an enjoyable stay for a great price.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;White Hart;some good things...;so on a whole i enjoyed my stay here very much, the hotel is very clean and though the location is out of town it didn't matter too much as they operate a shuttle service twice daily of which it was just me each time. Would i stay there again? sadly NO, the internet connection is so bad and i needed to connect with europe (living on a small indian ocean island without internet myself, i chose a business hotel so i could get a load of work done and sent out) and i just couldn't get anything done (but this was just my needs), would i recommend this place to others though? YES, for a holiday hotel it is very good.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;hou_feng_chuan;( Amazing Staff );Stayed for 5 nights.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Karuna W;Great friendly hotel that i would return to;This will sound like an ad from the management but having visited the finest 4 stars hotel in Bali. The Atanaya Hotel so far exceeds my expectations that it really is in a class by itself. The room was stunning and the service was excellent, you will get an excellent service from all of them staff. We were fortunate enough to meet the General Manager upon checking in, and had a very pleasant chat with him. I also asked for his help on making the birthday surprise of my girlfriend, and it was fantastic, over my highly expectation. They help me to prepare the room, also give me insight how to set the surprised, prepared it nicely and coordinated it for me as well. The pool was excellent, with the rooftop concept and had a great swimming experience there. Nice!;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;suryadhamma;Nice and Comfort;"Stay here for 4 nights, room is clean and the space is enough for solo traveller. Bed and pillow also comfort, the lack is I got room with ""Krisna View"" and on weekend morning it was very crowded and a little bit disturbing me.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Mah_Alibrahim;Amazing and very helpful staff;We spent four days in the hotel, the place is clean and tidy, staff are very helpful and nice. They care about the customer. The swimming pool is amazing, and the breakfast buffet was excellent. It is a bit far from Kuta beach, but a Taxi trip for about $3.0 will take you there. Close to Seminyak.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Eka S;best hotel with a good breakfast;when i came to tis hotel for the first time i think this hotel just normal hotel, but then i know the hotel is different, with a rooftop pool with sunset view. but the most part i liked is the breakfast, it was really good the taste and the menu is complete and delicious. the staff is perfectly kind and helpful. Bad section the only bad things is the wifi signal, its not working at all, and the security staff some time didn't even smile when the guest came. but overall recommended.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Laura Maree H;Great experience;My boyfriend and I stayed at the Atanaya for 4 nights! We had a lovely experience! The room itself was a decent size and had everything you needed! Air con, fridge and kettle! The roof top pool was amazing and we visited multiple times a day! The location is also great! It's only a $2AUD cab ride to Central Kuta and if when you're trying to return your cab driver doesn't recognise the name of the hotel just say it's next to Krisna! Everyone knows where Krisna is! Which brings me to the next positive! Krisna is a huge souvenir store and it has very cheap things to set the bench mark of how much to pay on the street! You should definitely check it out! I would have given 5 stars but unfortunately the buffet breakfast wasn't the greatest and we had quite a few language barrier…;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Chandra A;The best budget hotel in kuta;I think with the affordable price, this hotel with the all facilities always give you more satisfaction..

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Travaello;Nice affordable stay;The rooms are very clean and cozy. The staff is always very kind. The rooftop pool is awesome! Compared to other stays with the same price range you really get something out of your bucks here. Many other accommodations provide pictures on the internet which are simply wrong and not what it looks like in reality. If you're looking for a quiet, clean place the atanaya is the right thing for you!;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Travellovercouple;My Second home;Atanaya is the place that we would go to whenever we are in Bali. We were staying in this hotel from the 16 March - 22 March. This was my 3 trip to this hotel. Every single staff in this hotel are awesome. They are extremely friendly and helpful. I do not wish to put names because every single staff of this hotel deserves recognition. They have an awesome swimming pool on the 06th Floor of the hotel which is the rooftop. On the right of the hotel is the Krishna Oleh Oleh shopping paradies. You can get everything you need from this place but its fixed price. Please shop at Kuta Art market if you want to bargain. I have been recommending this place to all my friends who are interested to visti Bali. This hotel is withing walking distance to Macdonald and Bali Green Spa. Book…;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Tiny.the.Adventuress;Value for the money;The hotel room is quite small yet clean. It is close to a souvenir shop and restaurants. It is away from kuta's crowded beach but may seem to be noisy at night since it is located on the main road. It's just difficult to speak with them since they don't understand english much but despite that the staffs are nice. However, I just have to argue with them on my last night since they said there's no available driver to send me to airport which I said is included in my booking. They managed to solve the problem.;4;0;0;0;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Travelersdjournal;Love the sky pool!;This hotel located at the main street in Seminyak, Sunset Road. Which access to airport was really nice. One thing that we love about this hotel is their sky pool... the design is simple but very interesting. Good ambience for chilling either at day or night. At the night, the lightning inside the pool makes it realy cute! But it only open till 8pm.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Ahmad Seiichi R;Way beyond a regular business hotel;"okay, so I have read tons of positive reviews regarding this hotel prior departing, especially in regards to its location. However, Atanaya offers a lot more than just 'location, location, and location'. Me and my spouse went there last month, on 13-15th February (2015). The airport pick up was just excellent; on time, plus the driver was very helpful. Upon arrival, several staffs already greeted us when we stepped off the airport shuttle. Check-in process was also without a hassle, smooth and fast even thought we arrived early for the check in. Welcome drinks and a lovely towel art welcomed us in our room. The room itself was clean compared to other Indonesian hotels standard. No annoying smells or anything. As for the bathroom, thought it was squeaky clean I'm sure, but the…";5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Lucy M;All you could want, really;It's not on the beach... And that's the only compromise you'll have here for the low price you pay. But to be honest the beach isn't the sort of beach you want to be right by anyway (unless you're a surfer.) You can get to town easily with a metered bluebird taxi for just a couple of dollars. The room was exceptionally clean, and very comfortable. Spacious, but cozy. The shower had good water pressure and always hot water. Lots of TV channels. Wifi worked well. Rooftop pool is great. Breakfast was amazing. They even have fresh whole wheat bread! Not all the staff speak English. Their laundry service is insanely overpriced, about three times the cost you would pay in Europe or North America at a hotel! They charge per item, and really ought to charge per kilo.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Dodde_Mokarisma;Really affordable and nice but need attention for Safety issue;"Okay let be honest First. The rate for this new and 4star rating hotel is really affordable. Book through hotelquickly apps which help for additional discount. So the first impression was okay. Upon arrival, me and my sister were arrive lately around 6 pm so the check in was running smoothly. the staff looks helpful. nice one remembering that I'm the locally guest which had experience some bad issue in other places regarding the ""local differentiation"". The pool. hmm could be I say this is a little Marina Bay Sand hahaha. The glass wall rooftop pool looks nice at the nights, especially the night city view while you swimming out there. at the morning was also nice, but some construction besides are blocking the environment. Rooms are okay, nice touch of brown and wooden…";5;1;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;matthew f;Memorable stay;We had a very nice 4 days stay at Atanaya hotel during our December break. The room's great in size, really cozy and bathroom size's great for western size people like me. They have reliable internet connection which is really important since my kids addicted to their tablets. The staffs were friendly and attentive, credit to Wayan the HK manager, he is my man. They served decent breakfast which lot of varieties and I believe it can be improved more, but yet is already fulfill our hunger in the morning. One of the best thing I can't forget is their pool, which is very modern with the glass wall and you can see through it when you swim. My family had a nice time there. Thank you atanaya team to make our stay a nice and memorable one.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;prozium95;Great Bali hotel;I'm currently staying at Atanaya Hotel for two weeks. It is a great hotel and I am enjoying my stay here. The infinity pool is great and unlike anything else I've seen personally. Perhaps live music during the day could pump up the atmosphere. The rooms are nice and comfortable, decent size too! I have stayed at many hotels and the housekeeping at this hotel are the best I've ever seen. They are fast, very friendly and and efficient. I love that they go the extra mile and will wait until I leave the room to clean. Location is slightly inconvenient but it is very cheap and easy to head into the centre of Kuta, I knew this when I booked the hotel. Breakfast is good. Would recommend!;4;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Tess H;Location was not so bad;We booked the Atanaya due to it's great price. I was worried about the location but at the end of the day it wasn't to bad. It was a cheap 22k rupiah into kuta central and easy access to get out of kuta on day trips. The roof top pool could use some greenery and trees for natural cooling shade as it was quite warm up there and not so where you could relax in comfort. Also the tiles around the pool were very very very slippery. Breakfast was ok. Only 1 juice on offer. A couple of extra choices and it could have been great. The north side of the hotel has construction happening 24/7 so don't book and pay the extra for an executive room if you don't want to be kept awake with floodlights and grinding all night. We actually downgraded to a smaller room to get away from it on…;4;1;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Koumaal;Value for Money!!;Atanaya is a very warm boutique hotel centrally located. The staff is the biggest asset to the property, they are very friendly and caring. The rooms are very spacious and ideal for relaxing. They have a roof top pool which is a great place to chill out. Must to try there is the Go Green Juice.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;abdul s;a very nice hotel near kuta;Me and my wife stayed at the Atanaya from 21 april till 23 april 2014. Atanaya is very comfortable place when you visiting bali, it has a complete service such as rent car, rent motorcycle, rooftop swimming pool and it is near from Khrisna, one of biggest gift shop at Bali. I thought you must try to stay in this hotel and you can give your opinion.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;William T;best second stay!;This is my second review, since my first stay, I think Atanaya has been improving a lot. Besides its location which next to biggest gift shop in Bali, it only takes around 10-15 minutes from airport and Kuta beach. Their service also good, staffs are really helpful and friendly. This hotel also clean, tidy, and nice to relax. I'd recommend this hotel for family vacation and a long holiday. cheers!;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;kammelh19;Perfect for leisure and business;This hotel serves the purpose for both leisure and business hotel. Reasonably priced. Perfect value for money. Rooms are nice and clean. 10 min for the beach, I still prefer this hotel as this for my next visit. Reason being hotels near the beach are too crowded and not a safe location.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;kamileee;nice, cozy hotel;We stayed in Atanaya for 10 nights and it was really lovely. the staff was very friendly and always ready to go that one extra mile whatever you need (a call, transport, food, laundry etc.). Hotel didn't feel luxurious, but we felt like at home - it's so cozy. Breakfast was nice as well - you could choose between indonesian and international cuisine, which made it ok for all guests staying here. Pool on the rooftop was awesome! Much better than in photos on the website :) The only negative thing i could think of was a constructions site right next to the hotel - being noisy most of the time in the evening.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;jongfoo;Good & affordable;My family stayed here for 4D3N in mid Sept 2014. The hotel was generally clean and the staffs were helpful.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;shandysatya;Good and affordable price!;Stayed for 4D3N at room 114 in early Sept '14. Some points on my experience staying at Atanaya: 1. Room was clean and cleaned daily, they have well working air conditioners and hot and cold water showers 2. Breakfast was good (great croissants!) 3. Quite good location I travelled around using motorbike (which i rented) it took about 20 minutes to get to Kuta beaches and just another 20 minutes to get to the airport by taxi. 4. It's next to Krisna (good Bali gifts store that sells at good price) 5. Staffs are friendly and helpful 6. Unfortunately although they provided free wi-fi, I was unable to access it not even once during my 4d3n stay. Hope they can fix this next time. 7. If you are staying here, it's a bit far to walk around but if you can ride a motorbike then you can rent…;4;0;1;0;0;1;0

Keep up good work and please consider my criticis to improve hotel quality.;4;1;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;DutchTravelerrr;A nice hotel and great service for a good price;A good hotel and very friendly staff. The rooms are very nice and clean but a little bit noisy and damp.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Hans Kristian H;Comfort place to be.;Very nice rooms, shower is perfect compared to many many other hotels around. Roomservice do their job every day, think even they change sheets every day? im not sure. Pool on the sixht floor is amazing, you can enjoy the view and get a light breeze on your body while laying in the sun bed, the water is a little too cold for myself but when you are active in the water there is no problem. Very friendly staff, they are helping out with whatever you want. Food is good, breakfast is better then avarage ive tasted on other hotels. This gets top score from me.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;sugarvictim;Fantastic Price, Comfortable Room;We started off our trip to Bali by showing up a day late. The hotel was quite accommodating of my blunder. They spoke enough English for us to get by. Recommendations for local attractions and restaurants were readily given. The hotel is far from any beaches but you can get a cab very quickly and inexpensively. The pool is beautiful and necessary with the humid, hot conditions. My only criticism is the price of the food at the restaurant. It was very expensive compared to any other meal we purchased. Would go back in a heart beat.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Andrew D;Good value starting/finishing point in Bali;Not too far from airport and close to Kuta (if that's what you want). This is the second time we've stayed at Atanaya and will probably stay again when we come to Bali. The rooftop pool is a treat for the family and the price is a treat for me. 4* hotel that is quite new, maybe 2 years. Bed is comfortable and bathroom clean. You might bet a bit of noise from the road, depending on which room you get, but that's to be expected in the Kuta area.;4;0;1;0;0;1;1

I booked for a deluxe room but the hotel management give us an upgrade room to Junior suite. I really enjoy my stay here. The hotel staff are so friendly. As I stayed with my 2 friends in one room, in the second day after the room made up, we got 3 towels and 3 mineral drink bottle. Really an excellent service.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;DC4life;Beautiful hotel with fantastic staff;My husband and I stayed at the Atanaya Hotel for our honeymoon and had a fabulous time. Upon checking in, the front desk associate told us that we were upgraded to an executive room. The room was modern, but still had beautiful Balinese decor. Though the Atanaya is technically in Kuta, it's actually closer to Legian/Seminyak, so it's not in the thick of the party atmosphere of Kuta. It's also walking distance to plenty of restaurants and shops, but taxis are easy to find, if you need one. The staff at the Atanaya is so wonderful. The associates are so friendly, and genuinely want to ensure that you're having the best experience they can offer. The rooftop pool is also amazing. My husband and I hope to go back to Bali again soon, and we will definitely stay at the Atanaya Hotel…;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Strategically place at Sunset Road (next to Krisna Oleh2), it just takes around 10 minutes to Kuta beach, Seminyak, Denpasar, or Ngurah Rai international airport by car. The room is very nice and comfortable, far away from the noise of Kuta's night life that make us have a quality sleep. Atanaya's Indonesian buffet style breakfast is also delicious. Moreover, I love their rooftop pool and friendly staff. Atanaya hotel is highly recommended and I would suggest anyone who wants to travel to Bali to stay here. Thank you Atanaya! :);4;0;1;0;1;0;1

We only needed couple minutes to arrive at hangout places in Seminyak and Legian. The Hotel is exactly right beside Krisna Oleh-Oleh so you would not waste your time to go find some souvenirs or snack. The service was very nice, cannot ask for more. The rooftop pool was very nice as well. I would recommend Atanaya as the perfect place for you to stay in Kuta!;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;lidabubakar;Unexpected sunset view from rooftop;I pick Atanaya coz it was a new hotel. There was a promo at Sgd147 for 4 nights! Hotel situated right at town area away where u can just take cab down to Seminyak, Kuta beach etc. Only gonna cost u $1.50-$2. Had a good sleep during our time there. Beds are comfy. Love their infinity pool and the lounge bar. Also don't forget to catch the sunset from the roof top. It was beautiful! At the left side of the hotel, there's nasi padang (You can see indomaret & polygon logo). For those who's up for supper. If you walk further down there's a mall call sunset star(i hope i get it right) where u can have fast food Macdonald, DIM SUm inc etc. Food there is awesome. Heard there's another dim sum shop opp of sunset Star. Don't forget to try seafood at Kepiting Sukro near the hotel too.…;5;0;1;0;0;0;1

It's clean, great location, beautiful, the staff are awesome, the pool on the rooftop is one of a kind and the food there is simply incredible. The bathroom is so clean and the shower is amazing too. I would suggest ANYONE GOING TO BALI TO STAY HERE. I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT BE UPSET WITH YOUR CHOICE. My wife and I are going to go back one day! It was truly a one of a kind experience & it's perfect for couples! The manager and hotel staff were very hospitable and did not want us to leave. When you stay at Atanaya it feels like a home. The other visitors are so friendly as well. The love there is amazing. Thank you Atanaya!!!;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Morningsider;Perfect base;Stayed for three nights during the Easter break. Location is away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta, but is ideal for trips from/to everywhere on the island. Room was well appointed with international TV channels and everything worked as expected. Wi-Fi reception was excellent and there was even a computer downstairs should you need one. Buffet breakfast was a mixture of Western and Indonesian cuisine. There was also a pastry shop by reception. There were two spas within walking distance and a Starbucks, McDonald's, and an ice-creamery just a tad further up the busy thoroughfare. The hotel provided a private Ngurah Rai airport pick-up/drop-off service, which was quite handy. The place served as an ideal base and proved to be excellent value for money.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Buzz0ff;Nice and comfortable;Atanaya hotel , lovely hotel great price clean , bathroom lil small, also a bit noisey cause it's on man sunset road, staff were very helpful and friendly and stored out luggage for a week.

My personal rating would be 7/10.;4;1;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;William T;nice place at affordable price;it has comfy and clean room for a normal rate. Staffs are friendly and informative. If you want to buy gifts, there is a big shop, Krisna besides this hotel. one disadvantage that I can think just it is quite far from beach, but you can take a cab or just rent a car. otherwise it would be the best. Cant wait for my next trip;4;0;1;1;0;0;1

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;potatochip77;Amazing;Beautiful hotel with an absolutely amazing breakfast. You feel like you are staying at a much more expensive place. One problem is that it is a little far from the beach, about a 20-30 minute walk, but a very short cab ride (take one of the metered blue cabs).;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;AnandBaskaran;Good rooms at great price;We stayed in the hotel for 5 days (20 - 25th March). For a budget hotel, room size was very good, clean, staff were very friendly, roof top pool is superb, air conditioner was super cool. Buffet breakfast had both balinese and western food. Also had a complimentary airport pick up and drop off. All hot spots were accessible by taxi ($2), location was right next to a sovenior shop and walk in distance to carefour (Kmart like super market). Dinner and cocktail menu needs a bit more of variety and small kids toy room shall be added to the facility so that kids can play while adults enjoy their drinks.

No problem at all but the bathroom is small. Breakfast was good. You can choose what you like, Indonesian traditional's food or western like sausages, hashbrown (everyday they change the menu) and they also have infused water. The swimming pool is on the rooftop but the water is not clear, too foggy. I hate it. The staff are friendly and fast respon. If you want to go the beach, you have to go with a car or motorcycle for 5-10 minutes, its too far if you walking. Atanaya's location is right next to Krisna souvenir shop so make sure you don't forget to buy souvenirs.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Herdon H;Great Hotel;"At first, we were very disappointed, the view was nothing, there no beach around or any good spot which we could go on walk. But later after we decided to see Bali as an Island, this hotel has really good spot, altough its NOT near the beach( u need a taxi to go to Kuta beach), but if u planning to see the other side of Bali like Uluwatu, Ubud n other places, this hotel is easier to come n go. This hotel also near the ""Krisna"" to buy Bali souvenir. Also the staffs is really humble, very good management hotel. The room is clean n comfy Note : if u got a complain.. just call out the manager .. they 'll give a better solution .. hehehehe >:)";5;0;1;1;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;travelblum;Great hotel for a great price;We stay at the Atanaya in late early 2013, only a few months after they opened. The service was great, the room was excellent, and who doesn't love a gorgeous rooftop pool. The room also included a welcome dinner and breakfast the next morning. For the rate we paid, this was an absolute steal. The staff was extremely helpful and nice, you can tell they want the hotel to succeed. We used the Atanaya as a stop-over before making our way up to Ubud. We landed fairly late in the evening, and figured it was best to spend the night at a reasonable property near the airport before heading up to our more expensive hotel in Ubud. I would highly recommend this hotel for a stop-over or even a longer stay. Extra Tip: One of the biggest souvenir shops is right next door and they have some…;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;stamoura;Clean and affordable, a winning combination;Stayed there for four nights. The location is good if you want shopping and restaurants but a bit far from the beach if you don't have a scooter. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. WiFi works in the room and the pool was great when we weren't at the beach. Best of all the staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. I was sad to leave.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Hanana H;Easy access to everywhere;"If you want to go to legian, seminyak, or kuta this hotel is highly recommended. Only around 20 minutes from airport and just a few minutes to ""Krisna"" is one of the most favorite shops souvenir in Bali. The room are simple and comfortable with a small bathroom (for deluxe room). I love the sky pool..not large enought but really nice. Minus point only on the breakfast, the taste just so-so";4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Guillaume R;fine;We stayed .2 nights at Atanaya hotel after a long flight. Overall was a great stay, the room was clean ans staff very friendly and very nice buffet breakfast. But few things didn't satisfy us: - Bathroom is small and a musty smell was coming from the shower. - Ask for a room not overlooking the main road because it was pretty noisy at this time.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Rendy L;Nice hotel, I think I will stay there again...;I reserved the room for my honeymoon trip via an online service, and I got a really good price. The reservation include 1 airport transfer service. When I contacted the reservation department several times, their response is fast and helpful. To my surprise, Deksu (the staff who pick me and my wife from airport) send a message to my cellphone, told that he waited for our arrival. At the reception, after they check my reservation (including my honeymoon remark), they allowed us to keep out luggage at their office, because the room is not ready yet and we have a trip scheduled. When we arrived at the hotel at night, another surprise wait us at our room. The staff have prepared a pair of swan using towels at our bed, which is really nice and romantic.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;TraleeTraveler;Excellent Staff and Food. Annoying Taxi Drivers;The hotel is very nice, no complaints. However, very annoying to be plagued by taxi drivers once you leave the hotel. Plus one of our taxi fares was four times the price of a metered cab,even after haggling. One thing is for sure do not give them more than 50,000RP for the fare if going anywhere in Kuta. It's best to wave down a Bluebird Taxi as they pass by on a regular basis.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;simba_1949;This Hotel is Excellent, Gunawan was the main man for me. He was very good at his job.;Very nice Hotel, only 12 months old, Room spacious with all amenities required, bathroom very good with hot & cold water, everything in this hotel works as it should. All the staff are very friendly. It's the top end of Kuta near Legian but only 5 mins in taxi to the center of Kuta. I only stayed 3 nights but would have gladly stayed longer.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Kyrstwyn;Great Value;We checked in to Atanaya on our final day of holidays. We had a checkout time of 12noon at the villa we had stayed in, and a flight that did not leave till 10.30pm. Not wanting to spend the day looking for air conditioned shops or restaurants to spend the 8 hours we booked in here. The cost was so reasonable IDR315, about 30 Australian dollars. We then had the luxury of a pool to use, our own room with bathroom and room service. It was an extremely relaxing final day which can sometimes prove stressful, with luggage to look after etc. The hotel itself is very new, everything was clean. Not a huge room but for us it was all we needed. Also, its located next to a souvenir warehouse - if you happen to want a key ring or magnet the prices are unbeatable.;5;1;1;0;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Twindya;Lovely Hotel Experience;We went to bali for honeymoon and stayed at atanaya from jan 15th until jan 17th. We booked the deluxe room from rajakamar.com, and we really had a great time. here are some positive points: 1. the room was clean, and big enough for the two of us 2. the staff was very friendly, responsive and helpful 3. the location is perfect for us, because: a. The area is not crowded or full with traffic, but It is also located near from Kuta (10 minutes with motorcycle) and Ngurah Rai Airport (20 minutes with cab) b. It is located in mainroad (Jl. Sunsetroad) but the trafic didnt feel noisy at all at night, so we still can have our beauty sleep. c. It is located next to Krishna souvenir (open until 10 pm) 4. And the thing I loved the most was they let us checked in early. We took the first…;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Karl T;Karl, Therese and Hugo.;I really want to recomend this hotel. We checked in with a plan to stay for only one or two days. We ended up staying for more than a week. Location is not the best but a taxi to Kuta or Legian is only about 25000 rupiah so in this way you will see more of Bali than if you only walk out of your hotel room. The manager and staff have been so friendly with our one year old son so we really dont want to leave... Thumbs up and keep up your good work. Totaly a kids friendly hotel, and yes they have an excellent baby chair in the restaurant. See you next time we come to Bali!;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Alsey_B;Very pleasant;A nice hotel with very pleasant staff. Nothing was too much trouble. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The buffet breakfast is very nice, and the rooms are clean and nicely appointed. We particularly enjoyed the rooftop swimming pool as a nice place to relax. Most of the staff speak English well enough to be of help. The Manager Edy went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. WiFi in the room was a little flaky but good enough to get by. A fairly central location. Beaches close by. We had a nice time at Atanaya and recommend it.;4;0;1;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Poera A;Romantic;It was my honeymoon suit. So tomantic decoration special made for me and my love. And we got special romantic dinner.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;hiroaki t;another choice near Kuta Beach;first time looking at online, i think this hotel is Japan hotel because the name is Atanaya. but its peranakan, its a combine with chinese style. they have 1 lady is able to speak japan, and good communication and friendly, really help me. during breakfast, i spoke with the General Manager Made Edy san, he so friendly and helpfull, also try to speak in japan even a few only.... for me, this hotel is nice, but no bathtub and no spa in room. the most important is, their staff is very helpful and friendly. if you are the first time came to Bali, just ask to the reception for tour, they will help you... .;4;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;travelkeeday;Nice for a budget stay;Hotel is nice and clean. Rooms were also neat with wifi connectivity. Also has a nice rooftop infinity pool.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;richyrich2014;Pleasantly surprised;With Kuta town totally booked for New Years, this hotel was an excellent alternative. I was concerned because it was not in Kuta town but actually it worked out well because it WAS outside of the traffic jams of Kuta, but still close enough to make it Kuta and Seminyak easily at any time of the day (via motorbike or a little walk). This location worked out better for us because we were able to quickly go to Nusa Dua and Uluwatu (again avoiding massive Kuta traffic jams). Via motorbike we went out to Seminyak for dinner almost every night. And when we were feeling like a short beach time, we went to Kuta Beach. The hotel itself is good. Clean, spacious rooms with a nice breakfast in the morning. My only complaint was the wifi was very poor (less than 1mbs).;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;imm64;OK;We stayed here for 6 nights. Its a nice affordable hotel with nice clean rooms (we had a Deluxe room) and very friendly staff. The only things we did not like was the dinner and the location. You have to walk around 30-40min to Kuta square or take a taxi. The breakfast was good, the dinner wasn't as good and overprized for the quality and quantity. The water in the pool looked milky.;4;1;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Jessica L;Good Stay and Good Value for Money;A good choice of accommodation for those going to Bali with a group of friends. The Junior Suite room can hold up to 4 people with a cozy living room for our late-night chatting or watching movie together. Nice, spacious room with good room service. I especially like the view from the rooftop pool at night - it is a great place to just sit around and have a drink. Strategically located atSunset Road, it takes only a few minutes ride to reach the Bali's vibrant places such as Seminyak and Legian, Kuta. With the opening of the new expressway, it becomes convenient to reach resort beaches in Nusa Dua from here. Overall, it is good-value-for-money hotel! (PS: Their breakfast menu is really not bad if you are going to try Indonesian breakfast.);4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Eugenia Fransis... K;A hotel worth to stay;Last November my friends and I stayed for 3 days at Atanaya Hotel. It is a great affordable hotel in Kuta. The room is clean, the staffs are friendly. And the location is quite strategic (I think) because it is just the next to Krisna, so you don't have to spare more time to find a place to buy souvenirs.;4;1;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;mattea2010;Good hotel right at the side of krisna;The hotel was great. I stay for 4 days with my family and daughter. The staff were helpful, the view from rooftop was great, but when we stay the water pool was not clean so you can not see anything in the water. overall it was great hotel. The best point is you can buy souvenirs at krisna right at the side of the hotel.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Frank F;Nice hotel;Good place to stay. Good staff. Good breakfast. Extraordinary service. Beside krisna which is balinese store,best point for this hotel.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;hdox;good value, clean and friendly;I enjoyed my 5-day stay here. Although the rooms were small, they were clean and well equipped. The buffet breakfast was good and all the staff were friendly and helpful. You will need a car or taxi to see the best of Bali. The hotel is situated well away from the shops and beach in Seminyak but it is right beside Krishna - a very popular shopping site. If you have your own car, you may find parking difficult. There are limited parking spaces available and I found it inconvenient to have to have my vehicle shuffled around.;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Saskia1968;Very good for One Night;This Hotel is located on a very noisy street in a not so charming area so you can't Expect quieteness or a beatuifull sourrounding. But knowing this And staying there only for One Night before heading to the Airport again, you get very good value for the Price. The rooms are nice And clean. The breakfast room is Open so you don't have to ist in ac. The breakfast was absolutely ok And the Staff is very friendly. We had 2 Standard rooms with a connecting door which was neat. We Would stay there again coming to the area.;4;1;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Paveena K;Good location!Amazing service!Clean hotel!Friendly staff!Nice Pool!;I recently stayed in Atanaya Hotel from Sept 18th to Sept 22nd 2013. I must say that among my 3 trips to Bali, this certainly would have been one of the best. A group of 4 of us went and we booked 2 deluxe rooms. Rooms were clean and bed was comfortable. The pool was awesome. Breakfast was good but can be better. They also provide shuttle to kuta area. However, the shuttle was only enough for 4 people. Not sure if they have shuttle for bigger groups like 6 and more. As for the staff in the hotel, they were extremely polite and helpful. No complaints about them at all. One of the waitress, Daisy, was really nice and friendly. Even the F&B manager was really nice. I forgot his name though.

The amount I spent on taxi!, I think you can get a hotel on Kuta beach for the additional amount.;4;1;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Mimi E;Neat and clean hotel with nice staffs;Prior to arriving in Bali, I arranged an airport pick-up, but I waited for the driver for around 30mins. I think they forgot about it since I had to call them and remind that I have a scheduled pick-up. When the driver arrived, he apologized that he was late which is fine. The staffs were accommodating and nice, especially the Housekeeping team. They always clean our room so quick and never missed a day (except when we put a DND sign). Overall, we had a pleasant stay.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Marina Couple;What a terrific find.;My friend and I needed a place to stay for the night before we left for Lombok. We found this place on TripAdvisor and thought it would be worth a look. Wow! From the time we checked in to the time we took a taxi the following morning, we were impressed by the hotel, it's staff and the comfort. The rooftop pool was the highlight of the stay. We absolutely loved it. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom nicely appointed and before we left early in the morning they provided a little nosh for our trip to the airport. I would love the chance to stay there again. I rate it 5 out of 5 pillows.;5;0;0;1;0;0;1

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Sandra S;Clean Hotel, Feel like home and Romantic pool area in the evening.;When I decide to book to stay at Atanaya Hotel, I had no idea what I feel like.

The room size of deluxe is quiet comfortable, complete with the room facility. I also could open my email as the internet access is fast to connect. The view of pool area in the evening and morning are so amazing and romantic. I could watch sunrise and sunset. The location of Atanaya is not close to the beach and only at the sunset road but it has a good access to go to the beach, kuta, seminyak, denpasar and airport. The breakfast is served in buffet and quiet variable and tasteful. I also could buy some souvenir at Krisna souvenir…;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;dodisaputra;Excellent;In the end of our last business trip to Bali, we decided to have an extra day off to relax. Then, we think of Atanaya Hotel that we saw when we visited Krisna Souvenirs Shop before. It's a relatively new hotel in Sunset Road. Considering also it's located near to airport, so we booked for one night stay. We were amazed by the helpful and friendly staffs since the first time we stepped in. The room is nice and clean. And they have asian and western food for breakfast. All in all, we loved the roof top pool. The full moon light made the view from roof top look magnificent. We enjoy spending time till midnight by the pool. We definitely will come back to Atanaya Hotel in our next visit to Bali.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Rhian H;Lovely hotel, great infinity pool!;We only stayed here for one night but thought it was a very nice hotel.

We sat on the roof too - the pool is closed after 10pm (though im sure they would let you swim), and its a great view across town. We swam first thing in the morning too. The rooms are excellent. Someone made a typo with our flight number and the taxi wasn't there to pick us up, but we telephoned them and they got a taxi to us about half an hr later, and didn't charge us for pick up - excellent customer service!

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;MuhammadDori;Good service, good quality;I had stayed in this hotel for 3 days together with collegues for Group Outing. We really didn't expect much for this hotel since we got very affordable price for the rooms. But when we really got there, it was quite a shock! The hotel is so good looking, not to mention that they got friendly staff there. The room is quite large, clean, and cozy, so is the toilet. The breakfast is tasty with various choices everyday, and the hotel has an acrylic pool at the rooftop, which is so interesting.

The staff goes out of their way to take care of me, I get extra welcome dinner when the first stay, amazing for me if comparing with the hotel rooms price. There was a group of over 80 peoples staying at the hotel. What madness. During breakfast, all of hotel staff including the General Manager (Mr. Made) are very busy and very helpful for all of the guest. GM was telling to the staff to set up a reserved table for me so I was guaranteed a place to eat for breakfast. once again that's amazing ways for your customers.

Infact the location of the hotel is in Sunset road, boulevard road beside of Krishna Oleh-Oleh in Kuta and we found the location is not in the traffic jam area, so it's very easy for us to go everywhere in Kuta area. The size of the room is not quite big but it's nice to sleep, the airconditioning and wifi is very good for us as business traveller. The breakfast is quite good and we found the staff is helpful.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Sybran;Very nice stay in Atanaya.;We are just back in holland after 6 weeks in Bali Indonesia. The hotel we have chosen in Bali was the Atanaya Hotel. One word... WAUW. It is a good looking hotel. The price for a executive room is about 40-50 USD. In other hotels like this (quality) you pay much and much more ( 120 usd?!). I know what to do if I go back to Bali --> Hallo Atanaya. The staff ( wich I miss a lot) is really friendly and the hospitality level is great. I was amazed about the work formule, that it is professional like this but also gives you the feeling that you came home after the activities. The swimming pool on the rooftop is a place to relax. Not to busy and always clean. The kitchen serves local and western food, like western make it... In a CLEAN kitchen. All was good. We hope to be your guest…;5;1;0;0;0;1;0

Oxtail soup was very good and tasty, every day I ordered oxtail soup atanaya with my partner. location not far from Kuta and Legian, and the hotel is next to the shopping center souvenir largest in Bali, so it is very easy to buy souvenirs to take home.;5;0;1;1;0;0;1

The room I stayed in was clean and well-decorated with a peranakan flavor. The relaxing roof-top pool was a hit with my child and we swam there everyday during our stay. Breakfast at the well-ventilated cafe at the lobby was delicious with a good spread of eastern and westerns dishes. The hotel also provides shuttle service daily to Kuta beach and Seminyak Mall. Overall, the hotel offers good value for money with a personal touch. We would certainly return again in the…;5;1;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;stevi2013;Great stay and location;My family and I traveled to Bali last month and stay in Atanaya Hotel. We choose this hotel because it has easy access to Kuta, Seminyak, Sanur, Denpasar and pretty much any area. Most of all, it's just next to Krisna, one of the biggest Bali traditional souvenirs shops. Meanwhile inside the Hotel, we enjoy the tasty and variuos breakfast and the beautiful aclyric swimming pool. The room is nicely designed and comfy. We surely would choose to stay there again in our next trip to Bali. Thank you.... :);5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Satria Pinandhita;Friendly and Affordable;I was staying at the hotel for a week since I was on a business trip, and was very much touched by the friendliness of the staff. The hotel itself was very affordable, room was clean, spacious, and very comfortable, and it is not very far from the airport. It's definitely recommended if you were looking for a place to stay in Bali for either business or pleasure.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;didihardiana;Great hotel yet affordable;Atanaya is quite new hotel but very affordable price, considering the service and luxury. Spacious room, friendly service, delicious breakfast, and the unique pool on rooftop. The location quite strategic, easy access from airport and to tourist destination (uluwatu, seminyak, sanur, and kuta) and shopping center. Perfect for family with young children. I definitely will stay there next time.;5;1;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Eunice A;Comfy, clean and affordable;Nice and comfy for a short period stay. Nearby to Seminyak & Legian. The hotel was within our budget and we got it through a package. Big, clean and spacious. Just the bedding we had two single mattress joined together and not a king size one. Apart from that everything was fine.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Titis2404;good hotel, easy access;we choose to stay in Atanaya considering the sunset Road easy access to Seminyak area where we usually find places to eat & hang outs, but away from the traffic in the seminyak main streets. And easy access to Uluwatu/Ungasan. The hotel is basically a business hotel with a casual twist. Quite spacious room. Unfortunately the bathroom design is really small/cramp. Good b'fast. efficient for those who doesn't have time for souvenirs shopping, Krisna large Balinese gift shop is right beside the hotel building. :);4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Konfis;Great rooms, good service, no problems!;We were invited to basket wedding and the hotel was organised. Upon arrival some welcome drinks were provided. The room was a spacious double room with a lot of space. One rremarkable thing is the toilet flushing, it's like in airplanes with vacuum, AWESOME! Overall, a nice place to stay, only the entrance hall and the eating area is a bit noisy and hasty, as it is open to the street.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;j0annabanana;modern hotel with accommodating staffs;I stayed in 4 hotels in Bali during my vacation there but I can say that The Atanaya Hotel is the best hotel that I have stayed in Bali.

The hotel is new and has modern design,the room is clean and has comfortable bed, the swimming pool has a stunning view of sunset road, they have wide variety of buffet breakfast, location wise it's very close to krishna where i bought some Bali souvenirs and i think the most important thing in this hotel are their staffs, they were very helpful and accommodating and always there to attend to my needs, they were very friendly and always have a warm smile on their face.;5;0;0;1;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Felona H;Love to stay in here;"I like to stay at Atanaya Hotel. I went with my friends and we have late noght check in. The receptionist is understand that we are exhausted after night flight. However there is a mistake on our booking, we request twin bed but it come with double bed. Despite this, we love this hotel. The room is spacious, but the bathroom is quite narrow. The breakfast has variety choices and the food taste is delicious. The swimming pool has good view, i like swimming at the roof top pool and you can see the busiest road from the edge of the pool. The staff is very helpful and friendly and you can buy your souvenir from the store next to hotel, ""Krisna"". If you stay in this hotel, you might need to rent a car or get a taxi if you want to go out or have meals. Afterall, I like to stay in…";5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;YvonneAY;love is what makes a home;"Atanaya hotel, I was ever staying here before, when the hotel just opened up & i was awed by the unique concept of the Peranakan style. the hotel is beautiful & you know it just right away you stepped into it. I especially love the rooftop pool. It is so wondrous. Weeks ago I went to Bali again with my loved one and i decided to revisit Atanaya. It is indeed a great choice. I was greeted with warmer atmosphere. Some of the staff still remember me & we have some nice talk. The whole ambience is so loving. Frankly speaking, Atanaya has becoming a pretty butterfly now & i do experience the saying ""Love is what makes a home"" here. Thanks Atanaya & stay awesome!";5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;DarNT;Nice hotel, busy area;Hotel is set on a very busy road, very noisy traffic. Rooms are nice, staff are excellent, but speak very little English making communication hard. I travelled here with my 9 year old son, but we moved hotels because there is nothing for kids at all here. Would recommend this hotel to businessmen or single people, is in great condition and the restaurant is very nice.;4;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Yulie_CommentforTRIP;Nice business trip;Atanaya one of my favorite hotel when i was visiting Denpasar (Bali) for business trip. The hotel is near everywhere (strategic area), near Krisna (one of the big shopping center for local hand made) and near of the restaurant (especially sushi tea ---Japanese foods). The hotel service is excellent, all of the staff are help full. Their rooftop swimming pool is incredible, one of their unique character from the other hotel. If You come to Bali, just try to stay there... and prove my comment.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Ohmytravels;Good hotel, great pool, close to airport.;Would have given this a five star but the bathroom is just too small for that. Also, they need to sound proof their windows as the street outside is very busy. We did ask for a room further away from the street during check in and the staff were happy to oblige. The staff are great, actually. Got a welcome drink on arrival and the reception were friendly and personable. The beds are very comfortable, great pillows! A welcome break from slumming it in budget digs. Didn't get a chance to try the pool but it looks great. Will stay here again, especially if you need to be near the airport, only ten mins drive away.;4;0;0;1;0;0;1

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;ladyinred1234567;Hotel Staff enter room during the night!!! Do not stay here.;I would like to start by saying that there are loads of good points about this hotel. The roof top pool was amazing, reception staff and restaurant staff were friendly. Hotel was clean and rooms were nice. However, this was outweighted by one factor and one factor only. We booked two rooms at this hotel which had connecting doors. We left these open at night. At approx 5-6am, reception rang to see if a person from one room was in the other room. On having said no, Shortly afterwards two members of the hotel staff enter the other room while the guest in that room was asleep. I heard the door open and immediately got up. I asked if they were ok and they were more concerned about the connecting door being open to the two rooms. They eventually left, having given them the benefit…;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Tenette;Awesome Stay;We had a wonderful and awesome stay at Hotel Atanaya in Bali. The place is so clean and had a very welcoming and fresh atmosphere. The staff is very friendly. They gave me a cake to celebrate my birthday. They are all smiles and accommodating. And they even upgraded our stay to an executive suite. I really appreciate the help and generosity of Pak Rahman. He was there to meet us when we came. And i know he was the one responsible for the celebration of my birthday we a cake.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Mysecondhome60;Pleasant surprise;In March 2013 I needed to make a quick trip to Bali and found a package which included 7 nights at the Atanaya Hotel. The hotel is not in a tourist location, it is on the main ring road, where Bali Mal Galleria, Hypermart etc are located. However it is also very near Bali Brasco and only a 20 min walk into Legian Street, if you are feeling fit. The hotel offer a twice daily shuttle bus, at odd times, but you can ask to go in at different times, no pick up however. The breakfast was good and the staff are taking suggestions as to how to make it more westernized. The staff were so friendly, the hotel was spotless, free Wifi, and a nice infinity pool on the roof were nice extras. It is the kind of hotel business people use, due to it's location, and I would not recommend it to 1st…;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Theyonathan;Wonderful Hotel in Bali;When I go to Bali, I was confused where to stay . Finally I choosed Atanaya Hotel to stay for 3 nights. I really like the hotel. The room was so nice with the good decoration. The most thing that I like was the pool at the rooftop. The view was very beautiful, especially at night. I think this is the wonderful place to have romantic dinner with your couple. I also like the food at Atanaya Hotel. It was very delicious.

This is indeed an excellent boutique hotel with exceptional service far exceeding general luxury hotel standards. The staff in the hotel are a bunch of well trained, young, energetic and completely hospitable lot. They take customer service to a far new level. The rooms are very clean, good comfy beds, free fast wifi, powerful showers, a neat dressing table, coffee making facilities, good sized LCD TV, a safe and even a digital weighing machine. What more is needed in a good hotel room? The buffet breakfast has a very decent spread, the food is a mix of local and international dishes with a very good egg station. The hotel decoration is really nice, very Peranakan in its theme;5;0;0;0;1;1;1

Swimming pool is not big, but very lovely, I met a group of Korean beauties at the roof side Location: quite good. I hate bali's traffic problem, it is very crowd at the busy area.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Aditya R;Pretty Good!;I had a 2 night stay at the Atanaya, and overall it was quite pleasant. The room is clean and tidy when we arrived, the hospitality and service was excellent, the breakfast was nice (although selection was minimal), and the Sop Buntut was very good and i highly recommend it if you are planning to stay. Minus points is only the sound of the pool on the 6th floor. Since we stayed at the 5th, sound of water splashing and people swimming was a little annoying (it didn't stop until 11 pm). We recommend selecting other floors to stay, and to the owner, can you please soundproof it? we would love to stay again, but the sound (again) is a little annoying when you're trying to sleep.;4;0;0;0;0;1;0

They have very lovely staff and service. Their refreshment drink is so wierdly delicious. I highly recommend this hotel.;4;0;1;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Bri573;Overall pretty good.;"We stayed here one night only on 7 May 2013, before travelling on to other places. The staff who checked us in were lovely and couldn't do enough for us. The room was great, enough space and a comfy bed and pillows. The water from the bathroom tap was of concern though....after running clear for a moment it turned a very dark shade of brown, almost black, and left the basin lined with sediment. This happened half a dozen or so times. I'm not sure what it was, I'm not sure I even want to know, but at least there was no unpleasant odour with it. In our many trips to Bali we have never seen it before but I presume it's a problem with water supply in the area and not the fault of the hotel.

But the utmost experience was the hospitality of the staff in Atanaya, extremely helpful.

The swimming pool was a nice touch. One thing that really impressed us was the food that we ordered. Their Oxtail soup was awesome! :) Very pleasantly surprised that they serve such mouthwatering food for room service. Only gripe is that it is a distance away from Kuta Central and you'll need a cab to travel there but the cab fare there is really affordable so that wasn't a very big issue.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;SoloTraveler999;A hotel with friendly and helpful staff.;I stayed at the Atanaya between 2/12 and 2/23, using it as a base for day trips around Bali. It's location on Sunset Road is not in the center of Kuta, being about a 20 minute walk to the beach, but is outside of much of the congestion of that central area when traveling to other parts of Bali. Shopping, restaurants, convenience stores are all within a short walk. A mall with large grocery(Carrefour) is a 10 minute walk. The hotel is new, just opening 11/2012. The rooms are basic, with flat screen TV's, safe, table chair and bed. There was no closet, just hangers on the wall. The, bathroom is small an awkwardly laid out.

Not only that, when I walk in, I am also greeted nicely by the staff. The awesome part is the infinity pool at the rooftop. Swimming while watching sunset at Kuta Bali is an experience you could never get from elsewhere. Conveniently, just beside the hotel is Krisna Bali; where I could do my shopping for myself and for souvenirs. Overall, Atanaya is a place worth staying at.

Internet worked and room service was good. :) Pool on the roof was great, spended lots of time there on silence day. Food was good and staff was happy and helpful. I can recommend this place!;5;0;0;1;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;djphilthy;Awsome;The hotel is new and well designed.The rooms are a good size and the beds are huge and comfortable.The wifi internet is reasonably fast (better than most hotels).The staff were very friendly and well organised.The included breakfast every morning was great.The pool on the roof is amazing and the big round lounges were perfect for a lazy day by the pool.It was really welcoming that the manager Melissa spoke to us daily and was really nice.I would totally recommend this hotel and this is my 4th visit to Bali.It is situated approximately 5 mins from Kuta and Seminyak and costs approx 30,000 to 50,000 (AUS $3-$5) to travel by taxi which is nice if you want to be away from the fast pace that Bali offers yet close enough to go shopping within a couple of minutes.We will definately…;5;0;1;1;0;0;1
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;kaityd33;Great Choice;My fiance and I were really happy with this hotel. It was quiet, the food was great, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We loved the breakfast and coffee every morning! The pool was beautiful and the room was adequate. It was nice to have a mini-frigde as well as the universal outlet, plus fast free wifi. It would have been nice to have a small closet for hanging clothes as we stayed for 9 nights, but we managed with the drawers and shelves. We liked the location as it's removed from the crazy hustle and bustle of central Kuta, but still only a short taxi ride away or a 20 minute walk, plus quite close to the airport as well. There's also some great restaurants and shopping nearby and a great spa a few doors down.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;JYG_24;Great Hotel - Amazing Staff;Stayed there for 4N and our room rate included a daily buffet breakfast. The food selection was adequate and tasty and varied from one day to another. The staff were more than helpful and had a good command of the English language and were very keen to address any of our queries regarding places to visit and eat in Bali. One last thing. The restaurant food (albeit we only had room service) was the only time that we ate local food.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Kristoforus T;Very Good Hotel, Very Good Service;I stayed with my family for two nights. This hotel is very good, not only the building with its unique interior, but also the kindness of the people who provide the good services to guests. the rooms are great and the foods are great with reasonable price. We have a group dinner with 8 people at the restaurant, all are satisfied with the food. I booked this hotel thru agoda, previous night we stayed at another hotel at Legian, paid more but disappointed. Fortunately we move to Atanaya, we are very happy to stay at Atanaya.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Michael C;Best place for Meetings;I had meetings with my company in the Atanaya, the meetings rooms was big, could accomodate our needs, the coffee break, the meal was excellent, I cannot find the best peranakan food in Bali, but of course this place has served us. I might enjoy our meetings in the atiharsa, the meeting rooms next to the roof top pool bar which I can enjoy seeing the pool from the meeting room. in addition, the restaurant of kapur sirih which served with peranakan food it is very nice, during my stayed there I had chance to enjoy the coffee in Brewu, I like the coffee a lot. Indeed, the staf there were very friendly, as second home for me Will definitely come to atanaya hotel;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Angelique H;Awesome!!;I stayed in Ayana with my family in early this year, escaped from the cold winter in Amsterdam.

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Larry A;Good quality hotel and damn cheap price to match;My wife and I went to Bali for our wedding anniversary and decided to stay at the Atanaya Hotel after many arguments in which hotel to stay in Kuta. Im glad we made the decision to stay at the Atanaya. The room itself was nice, the buffet breakfast and dining area was superb and the service was prompt. Being the same age of the hotel crew, my wife and I really got along with them and we would exhange jokes and share our cultures. The only gripe I have is that the hotel itself needs to update their website with real life pictures because your hotel is worth showing off :). Thank You Atanaya for making our Anniversary a safe and memorable experience.;5;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;JasinK50;Interesting Hotel;Last December 2012, Mw wife,My friends in college and i went to bali for our end-of-the-year holiday. We stayed in the Atanaya Hotel. The Hotel is close to many interesting places in bali, such as Krisna and Pia Legong. Moreover, it is quite easy to get access to Airport and other tourist places as it is located on the main road. However, one thing lacked from its strategic location, the hotel is quite far from the beach. From the room point of view, it has a very interesting interiors and i will give two thumbs up for its cleanliness. I was amazed by its creativity as this hotel has the swimming pool on the sixth floor made from Akrilic. Lastly, i have any comment for the breakfast. The breakfast was pretty standart, but it was good enough for me..;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;ValoniaAyutthaya;A nice hotel, indeed!;The hotel is pretty new and has a cozy and clean. The location next to a popular shopping place makes it an ideal accommodation for those enjoying shopping. The reception area is welcoming and the front desk staff were efficient and friendly. Once they found my reservation I was taken into up to the room and checked into the room, was of a nice size. The rooms were clean, quiet and comfortable, and after a long day of walking it was great to lay down on the comfy bed. We got the breakfast buffet at Kapur Sirih Restaurant and enjoyed it every morning and evening. The Brewu Coffee & Pastry is excellent, not to mention roof top swimming pool on 6th floor!

Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;TANPOLIEM;Two thumbs up!;Very good hotel with very comfortable rooms - quiet and a welcoming staff. Me and my wife stayed here just two weeks after the opening in November 2012. It was really a friendly place, tiny though but that’s expectable in Bali. Staff was ok, lovely room on the 2nd floor. Nice bathroom, everything clean and well designed. Recommended! Poliem, TAN – Auckland (New Zealand);5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;VFXKristanto;Superb place for your holiday accommodation!;My wife and I recently stayed here for 4 nights on our alumni reunion. We had a really lovely experience of this hotel. Our 'classic room' was bright and nicely decorated, and always very clean. It was also a big bonus to have temperature-controlled air conditioning as it was hot in Kuta. The room I admit was fairly small but there was plenty of storage space for our luggage. The bathroom was bright, clean, and we didn't have any problems with hot water etc! The staff were lovely and always very helpful. Kapur Sirih Restaurant was amazing, food was very-very good. both dinner and the breakfast. I had an excellent time and would encourage you to consider a stay here! I hope to go back and stay at this hotel again sometime. Kristanto (Bandung);5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;Aang174;Best bargain;Tried this new hotel in Kuta Sunset Road, not far from Airport but you have to drive 10 minutes to get to Kuta Beach. The rooms are clean but you don't have a view. The shower floor need to fix to make the water runs smooth to the drain. By the way, the swimming pool in 6th floor is small but great, just like a miniature of infinity pool in Marina Bay Sands Singapore. Overall the stay was nice, foods were good and the staffs were friendly and helpful. And if you don't have time to buy something as souvenir, there is Krisna the souvenir center just next to it.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;EatPlayLovebySmitten;Atanaya is an excellency;What could you ask for more from a unique and comfortable hotel like Atanaya.. Located on the main street of Sunset Road & just next to a shopping place, it is very convenient for me to do everything that I love (especially 'shopping'). Not to mention another thing that I love the most: food, & they serve amazingly delicious food. I can't get enough of the martabak (indonesian pancake) and pecel (indonesian salad). When you visit Bali either for holiday or for business, either to learn about Balinese culture or to view the spectacular natural sceneries, I believe Atanaya could give u a whole different experience of Bali and make you love this haven even more. Atanaya, keep the excellency! :);5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;Atanaya Hotel;simon j;Very unique and exquisite;I was stay 2 night at this hotel, and is amazing. Ambience of peranakan culture in the hotel is very unique and exquisite.

The Staff was amazing, Over and beyond, at everything that they did, and took pride in what they did. ANYTHING I ask in reason they made sure it happen. They made me feel like I was more then just another guess. Location? It was no big deal after I learned it was a ten min scooter ride to the beach, it was awesome.

The staff here are unbelievably good, kudos to management - everyone here goes above and beyond, they are next level in my opinion. Currently staying in a Premiere Room (2536). Perfectly located on the 5th floor with ocean views, room is spacious and luxurious. Free minibar that gets replenished each morning an added bonus. Breakfast here is superb - the best buffet spread I have ever had and if you are staying in a premier room and above, you get to have breakfast at the Sands, ocean views and a lovely breeze in the morning. We also had dinner at the Sands, food was delicious and the cocktails are great.

The service and staff and attention to detail by the staff was as if it was centrally controlled as they remembered our names and preferences, experiences and needs from the get go. The grounds were superbly clean, quiet and well manicured often backgrounded by Balinese music which created a relaxing ambiance presided over by the ever present sea breeze. The villa room of large travertine and wood panelled features was fully air conditioned, had abundant personal accessories including a complimentary mini bar ( soft drinks) private pool and sweets delivered to the room every night as part of the turn down service.

We would like to thank the team at Anvaya , specially the team around the pool for taking so good care of our family. really Really nice people who took a lot of care for our 21 months little girl. Could not be more happier about the service here. Special thanks to Windu and Made who walked the ekstra mile regarding service. Both amazing guys. Breakfast was a chapter for it self, a lot to choose from and I think everyone will find something for their palate. The room is nice and delicate, we had 3 rooms where one was at the ground;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;SeeWithMrE;Great bang for buck and a little bit of everything!;I stayed at the Anvaya for 2 nights, one at the start of my trip and one to end my trip. Being close to the airport, it was good way for me to start and finish my trip. The hotel is in a quiet part of Kuta and was not as hectic as I imagined Kuta to be (however it is still Kuta so will be different to the feel of a Jimbaran or Nusa Dua). It has a lot of dining options around (local, international bbq and grills, indian, kfc, burger king) and is also close to the Discovery Mall (access to international brands). The hotel itself has a boutique feel to it despite being a large property. The beach in itself is not spectacular when compared to other parts of Bali but you do get a private beach view despite being in the hustle bustle of Kuta. Staff were always attentive and helpful.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Everything was clean, the AC worked fine. Nice balcony with two armchairs and a table. Complimentary water and beverages was replenished daily. In the evening you would also get a small sweet treat to your room. Fantastic breakfasts, with a lot of ready options and live cooking stations. Two restaurants - ""Sands"" with an ocean view, and Kunyit with traditional dance shows in the evening. I usually chose Kunyit for breakfasts, because it was less crowded. Dinners in both were excellent. In Sands you'll get also some western food options for lunch/dinner, while Kunyit is Indonesian/Asian focused. I recommend having dinner in Kunyit at least once, to experience the hands washing ritual and to enjoy the dance";5;0;0;0;1;0;0

He definitely went above and beyond to help us get the required medicine and constantly checked in on us. Thank you Erwin. You were very kind.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Prez;Great stay near the airport;My wife and I stayed here to end our 4 weeks in Asia and we loved it. The property is great and there are multiple restaurants on site including one on the beach which was lovely and fairly priced. You can pick and choose your fresh fish and it's grilled in front of you. Couldn't of asked for much more as you are eating right on the beach but in the comfort of AC should you please. We arrived early for our check-in and we were directed to a waiting area with complementary food and beverages which was a great touch. A treatment like this property offered in our own country of Canada would have been $1000 for the night and supper. I recommend this place 100p.;5;1;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Leonard S;Great Place to Stay!;This was an all around great hotel and experience. While the hotel is centrally located along a busy street with easy walking access to nearby shops and restaurants it also appeared to have a robust security team at the entrance. The lobby was appropriately open-air, but grand in scale with luxurious material finishes. The rooms were generous in size and well appointed & well maintained. All rooms had balconies. We only took breakfast in the restaurant, the food quality and selection was beyond superb. The restaurants faced the beach and presented classic resort atmospheres. Seating options included covered, but open air, enclosed and al fresco dining. The pool deck and restaurant areas were managed by Dewa who made sure that our group was well taken care of.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;FireTrill;THE place to stay in Kuta!;Just a 9min drive from the airport ! I had an amazing stay at this hotel! Every member of staff were so nice and attentive. They paid close attention to the fact I have a nut allergy and made me feel very reassured that they were being careful about what went into my food. This is the only hotel I’ve stayed in that put a note against my room number at meals so that all staff knew I had a nut allergy. This was helpful, as I didn’t have to repeat myself. Head chef in the sands restaurant, I B Wisesa, was so good at making me feel comfortable eating the food. The food was unbelievably tasty!The breakfast had an amazing selection and the dinner menu in both restaurants was very good. The rooms were extremely clean and the grounds beautifully maintained. This is THE place to stay;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Anda A;Lost for words;I am rarely lost for words when it comes to hotels and resports, but Anvaya is just one of those places that took my breath away. And I am speaking literally, due to their fantastic cuisine. While breakfast was already royal, the lunch and dinner choices were absolutely fantastic. If you have the chance, try the Kunyit restaurant - we had traditional Balinese dishes and I am still shaking how good everything was. I have written an extensive review in my blog (link in my profile). In terms of rooms, we stayed in suite with a small plunge pool, and the place was out of this world. I could literally move in the bahtroom and not get out for weeks :)) I am not sure about other rooms in the main building, but judging from the reviews, the whole place is great and well-managed.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Shantanu55;Gorgeous resort;A perfect holiday resort with activities and facilities for all ages. It was a five-day family vacation with smallish children and we fully enjoyed the resort. The rooms were good and well appointed. Although the hotel was full of guests, the beautiful layout and multiple pools gives you enough space and privacy. We never actually used the beach which was across a small road from the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff throughout the hotel. Getting a table with a view at the buffet breakfast at the spacious Sands restaurant was very chaotic but it was a culinary adventure with every possible international cuisine option. One of the most extensive spreads we have ever experienced. The Balinese restaurant Kunyit had good food and some music and entertainment. The kids club at the;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;peter h;Fabulous Hotel, oasis of calm in the bustle of Kuta.;Had the pleasure of staying at this resort for 25 nights from mid October 2022. I stayed with my wife, her parents and our two adult children. We had a fabulous time. The rooms were spotlessly cleaned everyday, the pools were well looked after too with a young guy constantly using g a net to gather any falling flowers from the beautiful overhead trees. It was an oasis of calm within the hotel and grounds, a huge contrast to the hustle and bustle of the Main Street in Kuta that the hotel is situated upon. The hotels breakfast was excellent with everything you can think of from Asian foods to Pork bacon and sausages. The fresh fruit juice bar was terrific too, freshly prepared, apples, carrots, orange, melons etc etc. They also had health drinks available, one turmeric flavour;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Maryanne H;Fantastc;We arrived at the Avaya hotel in Kuta 4 November. We had 14 wonderful nights at the hotel in a premier suite. The rooms were always immaculately kept. The pools the pools were constantly cleaned and the staff around the pool were 10 out of 10. The staff at the Sands restaurant were also 10 out of 10. They constantly without intrusion cared for us to ensure that our food and ambience were 5 star. The hosts at the foyer always knew our names, they where always interested in what ask we were doing that day and insuring that everything was okay with our stay. We thoroughly enjoyed the spa treatments we had. Again, 10 out of 10. I don’t think I’ve ever stayed in a hotel that I could rate 10 out of 10. We would recommend this hotel to anybody that needed to have a good break;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Hotel had 3 marvelous pools for all ages, Great breakfast restaurant on the beach. Beautiful gardens and grounds all very clean.

The service is amazing and it’s staff / team are truly 5-star! The Anvaya foyer, grounds and pool area are meticulously maintained. The rooms are beautifully decorated and beyond comfortable, they have everything you could possible need while away on a 5-star holiday. The buffet breakfast in the “Sands” restaurant is a culinary experience…..everything from Western Food, Asian, Indian, and Japanese. In the evening we dined in the “Kunyit” Restaurant whose menu specialised in Balinese and Indonesian cuisine….absolutely amazing food and service! The “Sands” also had a fantastic menu!

Everyone was extremely polite and helpful, we had an issue with the air con we were immediately upgraded to a better room without delay. The food here is lovely, with plenty of choices at the breakfast buffet and the restaurant at the front of the hotel is excellent for lunch!! I can recommend the sharing platters the specialties, amazing from start to finish! It appeared at night from the poolside that not a lot of people were using the restaurant but that's because they take you through to the beachside and sit you in a romantic setting, just lovely. Nothing was too much trouble, they have push bikes you can borrow and cycle along the beachfront, we did this a number of times and cycled into the town;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

The level of service is beyond parallel. The staff manager Erwin so friendly and helpful. Every time he saw us, he stopped for a chat to make sure everything was ok and we were enjoying our stay. Our room was excellent, just little uncomfortable as we arrived in the room, the drink bottle in the bathroom was opened and the water was half dranken. i asked the cleaning service staff to change and we get the change. The buffet breakfast is outstanding. There is a huge variety of foods and juices. Make sure you try the Turmeric juice, simply delicious.

Our family group had three rooms and we loved them. Our wishes to be close to each were respected. I have read negative reviews and I can't believe people blame the hotel for not giving them better rooms than they book and pay for! We were there for my birthday; and the hotel was sweet and lovely - perhaps because we didn't demand special treatment! All staff were so good and friendly, all meals were enjoyable, and we had a great holiday. Thank you all, and I hope we come again one day.";5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Andrew N;Fantastic hotel, incredible staff and i couldn’t recommend any higher.;Our stay at The Anvaya was superb. The facilities were exceptional. You have a choice of three pools, one for pool games, a shallower pool for relaxing and another bigger pool for swimming. We had a hour massage from the Spa which is exactly what we needed after long days out and it was very relaxing. The breakfast was amazing, we experienced both restaurants and both served fresh food from around the world with lots of choice and good ingredients. Coffee was made by a Barista and juices freshly pressed. The location is right in the heart of Kuta with many restaurants and shopping malls within walking distance. The hotel is right by the beach so you’re able to eat and walk with sunrise and sunsets. The room itself is modern with strong A/C, modern bathroom, nice balcony;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;David D;Super Helpful & Friendly Staff, and away from the madness.;So, I have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Anvaya, all I can say it's a great resort and amazing to sit and watch the sunsets of an evening, the price of drinks, although not extortionate are maybe bit more expensive than you would pay in the various bars. (4 Bintang: 310,000IDR inclusive of service charges and taxes). The are lots of steps around the place, but credit to the resort also ramps located next to each one. We stayed in a lagoon access room, but one thing I will note and maybe should have checked, the lagoon access doesn't lead directly to the main pools, and hardly anyone swims in the lagoons. The main pools are fantastic and more than enough beds, staff all around the resort are super helpful and pleasant, nothing is too much trouble. I have a few minor;4;0;0;1;0;0;1

Because we had visited this hotel before and we could not travel to Bali for more than two years due to COVID, we decided to stay there for more than seven consecutive weeks. Upon arrival we were treated like family and from that moment on we had the most fantastic stay there. Designed with a modern Balinese touch and with great attention to detail, the beachfront hotel is very well maintained and offers basically everything any savvy traveller in whatever age group would want for a luxurious holiday experience. Although it is located on a street that can be a bit busy at times, it is very calm and peaceful once you pass security and enter its expansive grounds that lead you through very well kept;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

The premium rooms are very spacious, beds are very big and comfortable. The bathroom is almost as big as the bedroom with double showers and tv above bath. My little boy loves the free bike hire, chess, ping pong and ball activities in the three pools. The spa is well worth a visit or 3! It’s across a little lane at the back of the property, you will also find another pool and swing there; great to watch the sunset.

We ended up upgrading again to a lagoon room which was perfect! Loved being able to walk out of our room & to hop straight into the lagoon. We took advantage of the breakfast on most mornings. The staff were always so friendly & welcoming. We loved the resort so much that we have already planned another stay here for next year...and we'll be bringing more people with us.

No apology and when we got to our room we were just dropped off. We complained and nobody from the hotel during the ten days we were there had the decency to come and check to see if we were ok . It's a shame as the hotel is genuinely very friendly especially around the pool bar area the staff in particular are superb. we did eat in the main Hotel Restaurant one night, However they were so interested in shooting a promotional film for the hotel in the middle of trying to serve us food, that the service we got was really poor. With so many nice hotels in Kuta I would suggest you look around until the hotel management get there act together;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Emma S;A calm oasis. Fantastic hotel, best in Kuta.;"The hotel is excellent, by far the most upmarket in Kuta. The staff and service they provide is outstanding; friendly and helpful. Breakfasts are of a very high standard and great variety. The pool is gorgeous and kept immaculately clean. Having the private beach is a nice touch with its calm water, as Kuta beach whilst perfect for surfing is often too choppy to swim. Having free bicycles to go into Kuta is also useful. Kuta itself is very busy and a bit downmarket. We missed the middle range price places to stay in Seminyak which was our first choice, but actually Anvaya is such a great hotel and the quiet end of Kuta so it worked out well. We were able to use it as a good base to travel to other areas, a bluebird taxi to Seminyak is about £5 and we hired a driver for the day";5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Shirleymorganti;Luxury stay;The Anvaya Beach Resort stands out in many ways for a luxury, affordable and friendly stay in Kuta. From the moment the taxi turns into the beautifully landscaped driveway where security checks all vehicles you immediately feel safe and welcome. The resort is less than a ten minute drive from the airport which is very welcome after a long flight. Check in is swift and refreshing with a cooling towel and drink on arrival. So many different rooms to stay in they are all cleaned to a very high standard with complimentary mini bars. We stayed in a premier room with a pool view and it was amazing. The rooms are large, the water hot and all the amenities you may need are there.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;GAVIN A;Pure escapism;We just spent 12 nights at this gorgeous hotel. We have stayed many times over the years in various hotels all over Bali but this stay in Bali at the beautiful Anvaya is surely one of the best we have experienced. After being stuck at home for nearly three years it was fitting to celebrate our first post pandemic holiday with a return to Bali. This five star hotel is just the right size for an extended stay....not too big and not too small. After several days all the staff became like family. What is changing in Bali is that hotels are improving their restaurants and making them as affordable as the resturants nearby. The standard of the food here was amazing. We ate nearly all our meals in the Kunyit restaurant or our near the beach. Every night there was entertainment of some;5;1;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Budi Soetjipto;Comforting with great view;I checked in at Anvaya after finishing our nearby dinner and got a deluxe room (see pictures). I went up to the room through an open and breezy corridor (see picture). Coming into it, I found a compact but elegant room, in which the size of the bedroom almost the same as the size of the bathroom. All amenities worked well during my stay, especially air condition, which I could set from very cold to mild cold. What surprised me was the difficulty of connecting to the internet. A technician had to be sent up to fix it. It worked but then on and off again. This internet connection saga continues in the next day. A thing that was supposed to be simple in many hotels turned out to be a complicated process in this hotel. It was a disappointment. After I reported again, the internet;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

I usually avoid returning to the same hotel as I like trying different places - but I might have to make an exception with this hotel. Reception: We checked-in late around 9pm. Reception staff didn’t have the room we booked (Deluxe) available so we were upgraded to the next room (Premium Deluxe) which was great. Also, when our flight out to Kuala Lumpur was rescheduled for 3 hours later than the original departure(annoying Air Asia) the reception staff Mr Surya.P helped us out by speaking to the manager to find out how they could assist - and assist us they did!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

There’s indoor, semi outdoor and outdoor area where you would enjoy your breakfast, i choose indoor area with AC and continue to having coffee and bread outside, with beach and white sands view❤️;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Akriti K;must visit place for a memorable vacation in Bali;Me and my husband stayed at the premier lagoon room in Anvyaya last month and had a spectacular time. the rooms are done tastefully. the resort is modern and a new property, provides all luxury facilities, has a private beach and the anvaya swing beautifully adds to its charm. strongly recommend staying at the premier lagoon rooms on the ground floor which has a small balcony deck and opens into a small lagoon which gives a feeling of a private pool. totally worth the extra money. Breakfast is out of the world both in terms of taste and variety. never seen such. variety at any five star report before. strongly recommend this place whenever in Bali, for a memorable vacation.;5;1;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Chad;The Anvaya;Our stay at The Anvaya Bali was simply sensational. The qualities and amenities of the hotel are first class. The customer service was an absolute highlight, the staff could not do enough to accommodate us. The restaurant Kunyit was so delicious, we ate there numerous times. I can not recommend staying at The Anvaya enough. We will most certainly be returning in the near future.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;kbartley7;Hospitality out of this world!!;I truly believe that the value of customer service is not when things go right, but actually when things go a little wrong. You spend hours looking at reviews. But actually I'm the type to look at the bad ones first. If you're like me then you're appreciate the honesty of this review. We had an initial hiccup with our room. But that was due to the travel agent over the hotel (I'd suggest premium over deluxe room). But regardless the management team stepped into fix it. From the very first day they jumped to attention to ensure we had the best stay. Service was amazing. Everyone was super friendly and helpful, always willing to go the extra mile. They even discussed us at their team meeting because different members checked in with us through out the week. The hotel is;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Two staff members for honourable mentions are Roby- he helps with the luggage and we arrived at the hotel around 2am, tired and disgruntled due to previous issues. he met us with a smile and cheered us right up! He also was the one who helped us with our luggage when leaving. He was such a sweet soul. Also Augusta- he works at the welcome desks and is so lovely!! Made our experience great! He helped us get our tours booked, gave us lovely places to visit and even helped us achieve discounts. He was honestly the best person I met that holiday. This hotel is amazing and I would definitely recommend!!!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;blaze4fun;Luxury stay not far from airport;"It's a beautiful hotel and super easy for getting between the airport. Rooms are very nice. Service was excellent in the lobby area. But the front restaurant was a different story. They have a young staff and we had some unbelievably slow service. A request to spit the bill for our large party was met with ""cannot do that"". After a long calculations they suddenly returned with separate checks. Then processing my credit card took well over 5 minutes (the others left cash). Drink orders took forever as well. One night the fire alarm in my wing went on/off many times. The front desk said to ignore it. Our stay, the pool and breakfast by the beach were fabulous. But some quirks made it lose a star.";4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Nick F;A diamond of a hotel.;Booked 8 nights b&b here and had a 5 star service. All the staff are fabulous and sincere. From the staff who meet and greet, to the pool staff, restaurant staff, even the room staff who turn back the beds every evening and leave treats in the room. The breakfast is more than adequate and caters for all tastes and prices are extremely reasonable for a grand hotel. It has 4 swimming pools and is located within walking distance from the centre of Kuta. There is a small private beach at the rear of the hotel but unfortunately, due to the weather at this time of year, the tide washes up a lot of debris during storms and it is constantly being cleared up. Apart from this, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel as a stay that is far enough away from the hustle of Kuta, but near;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Monica C;Good location for kuta;The hotel is close to everything, stores, restaurants, and the mall is all walking distance. The hotel has its own beach. It’s a very small area and the sand is very rocky along the water. But it is a beautiful view while sitting at Sands restaurant for daily breakfast. The rooms are average size but there is only small closet for hanging clothes. I had the lagoon access room. Loved the convenience of going for a swim anytime from my room. Overall the hotel was very nice but did not exceed my expectations. Check in was slow process especially waiting in the heat of of the open lobby.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Jayden_555;Fantastic, relaxing stay!;My husband and I stayed here in January. We had the most relaxing stay and would definitely recommend this hotel. The positives greatly exceed the small negatives although I will still review both sides. Positives - The staff and service are incredible. Everyone is constantly welcoming you and making you feel like VIP, especially the guest relations manager who truly made us feel so special. - The breakfast is wonderful with lots to choose from and since we were a long stay guest we were able to also eat at both restaurants for breakfast. The sands was our favorite with frozen yogurt and dumplings with a wonderful view of the ocean. -The room was spacious and modern. The cleaning team was fantastic with a wonderful sense of humor, leaving our towels int the shape of animals;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Anuj Shah;Perfect Location combined with Warm Hospitality!;- Located at the quieter end of Kuta and close to many Indian restaurants. - Haven of peace and tranquility with grandeur lobby, fresh air filled with soothing music of Rindik. - Breakfasts are just amazing and have spectrum of choices to spoil even for vegetarians. Start your day by having breakfast at the Sands Restaurant watching the waves! - Daily activites from 4 to 6pm connect you to local Balinese culture and their love for nature. - Cool breeze, sunset and a stroll over the beach will fill you with very fresh energy. - Impressed with the hospitality and personal attentiveness of duty manager - Mr Erwin Hutasoit (+62 812 38518881). Had a minor issue with cooling, he quickly upgraded our stay, provided many enticing perks, arranged special veg recipes at breakfast.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Every time he saw us, he stopped for a chat to make sure everything was ok and we were enjoying our stay. Ayin also took the time to chat with us to make sure were having a great time. Our room was excellent. The buffet breakfast is outstanding. There is a huge variety of food and juices. Make sure you try the Turmeric and Tamarind juice, simply delicious.

What great hospitality as we were gifted with unique fruits from Bali and cake/chocs. Instead of the typical resto breakfast, we were served with floating breakfast- food served in a raft floating on the private pool. This area was really exclusive and quiet. For our 2nd and 3rd nights, we availed of the Weekend Escape package which came with Sunset Tea for 2, Spa massage for 2, airport transfers and complimentary mini bar. Our room was a Premium room with Lagoon access. Such a superb deal and great value for money. Loved that its Kuta;5;1;1;0;1;0;1

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Eva Tarida;Good Place to Stay in Kuta Area;I was here for business purpose. It was a brief period but quite good experience. The location: located in Kuta area, there you have it. The good location to enjoy Bali daily life. However, with the hotel design that the receptionist is way back there, the crowd noise of Bali is dimmed. The room: It is quite spacious. The bed is comfy. The hotel sandal is unique not like any other :D However, unfortunately the room is not that sound proofed. So we can bit hear the noise from next door or hallway. Oh they also have 3 ballrooms or 4.. if I’m not mistaken. So if you wanna held a meeting here it’s possible. The foods: The foods were good. I like it. And the restaurant has its own outdoor space, so it was nice. They served pork bacon also and tbh the pork bacon was;4;0;1;0;1;0;1

This hotel has more than one swimming pools for those who love swimming. More importantly, Kuta Beach with its long jogging track, is only few minutes away.

I was a little bit disappointed of the fitness center, I was expecting something bigger and with more machines.

We had booked the pool access room, which included a secluded pool opened to all the guests who booked these rooms. It was quiet and so relaxing. A great shoutout to Made who made the best cocktails at the pool bar! There are also 4-5 more pools to choose from, depending on the type of room you have paid for. There is also Kuta beach, where you can go for a swim there with many decking chairs for relaxation. The location of this resort is also very good. The resort is central to Kuta, with many cuisines to choose from for dining. They also have the sands and Kunyit restaurant for breakfast and if you wish to dine.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Daniel G;Fantastic resort for first time stay in Bali;My fiancé and I stayed at the Anvaya from the 15th February - 25th February. This was our first stay in Bali. The Anvaya is a wonderful place to relax and unwind. There are plenty of things to do throughout the day and the staff are friendly and always helpful. There are plenty of pools both restricted and public access and it is also right near the beach. I had very little issues throughout my whole stay with the resort. The only thing I would say that was an issue was the Wi-Fi. For the first few days I didn’t seem to have an issue with it, but as our stay lengthened I started having a lot of issues and ended up having to use my data the whole time which was disappointing but not the worst issue ever. There is a breakfast buffet on offer and it has a lot of variety.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Swati S;Honeymoon Visit;It was indeed a special moment for us and Anvaya just added to the flavour, which we would hopefully cherish during each day of future. Coming outside home country to celebrate the occasion was prima facie a compromise on comfort, but we both were overwhelmed by the warmth of Anvayan's, such a terrific hospitality!!! each one appeared to have dealt with their roles so well. We want to say so much about it but just find ourselves out of words at this point. Ms. Ayin, who is assigned to Ops role at hotel looked at us like just another family member and that really meant a lot to us. Thank you Ayin!!! Would be incomplete without saying thanks to the man (team lead at Sands Restaurant) who offered us ever relaxing masala tea, we had it multiple times.......sorry but just not;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

They organised a birthday Surprise for my friend which was so special. I found trying to get an extra pillow a bit of a mission and getting 3 of everything in the room wasn't easy either but Ayin & Dewi helped out with that. Very thankful.

Three pools means the hotel never seems to busy and there are so many activities to do if you wish. The breakfast is to die for. They provide every style of delicious food you could imagine and their presentation is beautiful.

When booking a Deluxe room please be aware that you also get another breakfast place located in the Kunyit restaurant at the street while other rooms may have a breakfast at the Sands restaurant which is located at the beach.

There we were greeted again by a lovely receptionist who said our room was ready and we had been upgraded to a Premier room. The room was so lovely, nice comfortable bed and comfortable pillows!!! (we usually buy our own when we get to Bali!!) The mini bar was stocked and complimentary in the Premier room. The resort is beautiful, staff are lovely, Pools nice, water aerobics was so much fun.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;KEITH H;Super 5 star resort !;We have just completed a six night stay at The Anvaya Beach Resort in South Kuta. We can fully understand why this resort is so highly rated on TA. The facilities here are excellent and the all of the staff are the friendliest and most welcoming you could ever wish to meet. Most remember to address you personally by name when you meet them, and they could certainly teach a lot to many in the hospitality sector in the UK and Europe about excellent customer service ! The pool is great and you can always get a sun lounger without getting to the pool at a ridiculously early hour to reserve with a towel and a book, like many selfishly do at other resorts ! The breakfast at the Sands restaurant offers overwhelming choices catering to Indian, Chinese and Western clientele alike.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

We were greeted by the guest service manager Mr Sueka Pastama shortly after we arrived and he certainly went above and beyond our expectations in offering assistance. His kind professionalism impressed us so much. We loved our lagoon access room, it allowed us to swim straight off our veranda whenever we wished. The buffet breakfast included in our stay was out of this world, also offering freshly squeezed juices and food from various countries. The deck overlooking the beach was our place to sit at sunset and enjoy cocktails before dinner. My husband and I ate at the hotels;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;madaline12;Bali;My partner and I stayed at Anvaya for 8 nights in a pool access room. It’s close to the airport so easy to get to via taxi. We loved our room and the lagoon type pool connected to our room. The breakfast had a wide variety but being peak season it’s quiet busy after 8 am with guests rushing around some pushing in at egg stations feeling entitled. Staff will bring cappuccinos and offer to seat you in the air-conditioned room. Check in was smooth and staff are very polite. I wish there was a ‘guest’ review section as we were woken a lot of nights/early morning by the other guests yelling up and down to their friends and their kids running through the hall ways. And again in the AM with their kids on our little porch/pool access area. We had a lovely lunch that was part of;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

From the minute we arrived, we were welcomed and attended to with smiles, efficiency & professionalism. We had concerns taking our 80yr old in-laws to Bali and while they did not come along for some of the tours they stayed at the resort and were pampered and looked after so well, special thanks to Sanjaya from the pool area!

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;IreneSah;Highly Recommended;Kuta is not my favorite place to stay because it’s just so busy with human & traffic. I will usually stay in Kuta only for one night to do some shopping before moving to Nusa Dua or Ubud. But this time I stayed two nights in Anvaya and wish that I’ve booked a longer stay. Check in was a breeze thanks to Rian, at the Front Desk. He is polite and efficient. The premiere room is away from the main lobby. But that also mean that it’s far away from the noisy main road, Kunyit restaurant and the event hall of the hotel. This will be a better choice if you want to enjoy a peaceful night. Room is basic. A bit underwhelming for the price charged. But the bed and the pillows save the day. It is super comfy. As good as those used in Sheraton. Housekeeping did a great job keeping the room;5;0;0;1;0;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Līga B;Amazing hotel and reaturant;We are two travellers from Latvia stayed in Bali for two weeks in this wonderful hotel. Trust me, it is worth it to stay here. Staff is very friendly and always ready to help. Hotel is located at the end of busy area in Kuta and when you come home from the trip or even walk you fell how calm and pieceful is over here. Definetly recommending to stay here. Also, if you have only breakfast, they have amazing restaurant infront of hotel which serves Indoniasian food and it is not too expensive. we had amazing dinner there. special thanks to Wayan Darmawan, he was very sweet and took good care of us.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;drpete7;Frankly what’s not to love-service with a smile and great value;So I was warned not to stay in Kuta which is considered to be the trashy side of Bali. But when I saw this hotel had decent reviews I actually thought Kuta might not be so bad convenient and close to restaurants and amenities. Turns out that’s absolutely correct-we are in the rainy season and will it rains here it really comes down hard but we have a number of restaurants literally on hand and even late night massage shops closing at 12 am Back to the hotel the beds are very comfortable, room cleanliness is brilliant, attention to detail in the cleaning of the room is very sweet and all of the staff are gentle caring and smiling. Reasonable bathroom amenities provided, including a mouthwash! You don’t see this sort of thing in Europe these days where everything is pared back;5;0;1;1;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Felicia;One of the best Hotel;"Stayed in this hotel on Dec19 for 7 nights. And I have to say there are none of bad experience in this hotel. Everything was so good, from the room, cleanliness, but the highlight was the services. it was way beyond our expectation to the point that I think it would not be fair if we mention name as every single of them was so nice. it is so good to see how they clean and maintain the property every morning when we do our walk (even the beach area) and someone is actually always around the pool to make sure the pool are clean. Breakfast was so good. we still prefer in Kunyit rather than The Sand eventhough Sand has more variety, but for us, it was way too crowded. where in Kunyit you can enjoy your bfast and got excellent service. it was so good to see a little ""surprise""";5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Intan Dea Yutami;Nicely located and beautiful;The hotel is near the beach side, so you can enjoy sunset there easily. If you like to stroll around at any other time, it's quite nice too. Jog around the hotel along the beach line is quite nice to do, if you opt to exercise outside the hotel. Amenities are very complete, and I had a nice sleep here inside. I like the entrance to the lobby, where there are small pool around. Food and snacks for meeting are great.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Ryan M;Best Spot in Kuta, Bali;Been twice with family now and will come again with family. The Sands breakfast buffet is worth the stay but the service and environment all around are best-in-class. You get the lux privacy treatment with peace & quiet but you are only ever 100-meters, walking distance, from the main Kuta strip and all the action and dinner options. The beach is scenic and world class surf is waiting 15-minute’s walk north along the sand. We enjoyed the villa suites with private pool just as much as other rooms but do check that your room includes The Sands breakfast buffet, some only offer breakfast at their other restaurant, Kunyit, which is great but more Indian/Indonesian and we like a Western spread, so be clear on that point when booking. The Sands buffet is spectacular. The New Year’s;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Katy;Good experience and excellent location;We took a deluxe room - the rooms are clean and tidy with a decent bathroom. Not the most quiet though as you can hear the people above you move things and walk around.

The resort its self is stunning, multiple pools and relaxation areas. Clean and spacious with tons of activities. Eg : table tennis, chess and may others. There are 2 main restaurants. The food was good and the restaurant service is brilliant. I enjoyed the sands which has some cool music playing a nice swing and there is in an outdoor and indoor seating area.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;ferial1101;Our time in Bali;We took our time deciding where we wanted to stay and Anvaya kept coming up as the best place and so it was. We stayed there for 2 weeks(10 -23rd Dec2019). Rooms were clean, staff was very friendly. The guest services manager took very good care of us, Sueka Pastama. Good variety of food for breakfast across 2 restaurants. The grounds and pools were well maintained. We got upgraded to a suite which was just the best. The hotel is very central so its easy to walk around or use the grab cab to get around. I love the buzz of Kuta and once you in the Anvaya you just in another world. So i would definitely recommend this hotel, we will definitely stay there again. Ferial Haupt, Durban, South Africa;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

They catered to all our needs and we were given an ice bucket everyday and a stocked fridge which was perfect for the heat. The breakfast has a wide variety of cuisines and the spread was sumptuous indeed. We were given a connecting room to our suite all made possible by Mr Patriwan so that we could spend more time as a family together.

This is a detailed yet extremely accurate representation of our stay. Check In: You can store your luggage if you are early however check in time is 2 pm and room was not ready till 3:15 pm! Many people waiting in lounge, apparently housekeeping was overwhelmed ( not an excuse for a 5*). They gave out free coffee and water however. When the room was ready they just said here are your keys. No direction to room , no further instructions on where breakfast is and time and pool towels etc. We wanted a late check out since they were giving us a late check in, when we asked the reception seemed quite surprised and convincing them they gave it to us.;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

I ask the lady at check in if it was possible to check in early, I told her it was my second stay at the hotel. She asked me to wait in the lobby and she would asked her manager. After a nice coffee in the lobby the service manager ''Ayin Purwati'' came to see me in person. She offered me an early check in, and room upgrade, plus after 6 days I could have my breakfast next to Kunyit Restaurant, also in Sands Restaurant. When taken to my room an other surprise was waiting for me, a small basket full of very nice gifts from the hotel. What a amazing warm welcome! I stayed in the deluxe room with pool view. A very spacious room with all the comfort you need in it. But what really amazes me;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Screenwriterme;An oasis in the heart of Kuta;Kuta is the beating heart of Bali and the Anvaya is central. What sets it apart from the other Kuta resorts is a private swimming beach. Tables pools and the Sands restaurant right on the water! Other resort hotels just have a rocky breakwater. Boats use the sheltered beach to whisk you to the off-shore surfing reef or some great snorkeling spots. You could stay in one of the quieter cities on Bali but then you'd miss out on the restaurants shopping malls and nightclubs of central Kuta. (Not that you'd ever want to leave the exquisite landscaped Anvaya grounds.) One thing that impressed me is the security. Some of us worry about our safety when we travel and it is reassuring to see guards check every car entering as well as patrols on the beach and on the grounds. Service is;5;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;9Marcel;What was needed;Great resort and well located. The service was great and helpful and always with a greeting and smile. My room was perfect with a large bed, good aircon and nice clean spacious bathrooms with shower for tall people like me. Breakfast was great with a wide variety and always people to help explain some dishes. Pool area was nice and spacious so good to have some relax time. The beach area itself is not great for swimming but the setting itself is cool.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;elenam;Wonderful 5 Star Family Stay;After staying in many resorts, this is the only one where the resort is actually better in real life than in the pictures you can find online. We stayed as a family of 4 in a Junior Suite and everything was simply perfect. The pool was fantastic with plenty of day beds and floating cushions. The buffet breakfast was extraordinary and we would like to extend a special thank you to Tirtha and her team for their attention. The beach side location was extremely convenient. We will definitely be back and would like to extend a thank you to all the staff for their hospitality..;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;wandering soul;Awesome upscale resort;Anvaya is a very nice property in Kuta Bali. Rooms are nice and fresh. Beds are cozy and most rooms have a balcony. Pools are clean and well maintained. Pool access rooms would be a nice choice. Staff is extremely helpful and courteous. Restaurant offers a wide variety of dishes. Buffet breakfast has counters of Indonesian, continental and Indian dishes. There is direct access to clean not so busy beach. You can see planes approaching Denpasar airport and will be good choice for plane spotters. They have an extremely professional and hygienic spa too. Location is great as it's hardly 15minute away from airport and in walkable distance from two malls. Room numbering system is a bit strange here. Adjacent rooms may not have consecutive numbers.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Sam S;Surprisingly good for Kuta;I went for a conference and was surprised by how good this place was for Kuta. You don’t spend much time getting to the place from the airport. The check in procedure was way too long, unnecessarily. I think they are tying to make it an experience ... but at the end of the day I just wanted to drop my bag get into some shorts and meet with my boss. I stayed in one of the basic rooms close to the main road. It was small, but had all you need ... except a desk you can work on. The distance from the room to the beach is quite a way. The food was OK. Nothing to write home about, but you won’t starve or be unhappy. The Kunyit restaurant is on the road, so can be a bit noisy and hot. The restaurant on the beach is (not surprisingly) more a pleasant place to sit. Service was OK,;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Tara Destani;Nice Hotel with private beach;I stayed for two nights in the resort. They have so many pools and activities in the hotel. My favourite is yoga by the beach. They owned private beach, it is relatively small spaces but enough to stay relax catching for sunset. Quite close to shopping malls so if you want to go for foods it is just about a walking distance (though a long one). They have two different restaurant for breakfast depends on your room option, one is by the beach one is next to the main roads, nothing different with the food options though. If you are eligible to have breakfast in the restaurant next to the road you need to pay additional 100rb/ pax (if I am not mistaken) if you want to try to have a breakfast in the restaurant by the beach. The kids club is nice, owned kids pool inside, caretaker is;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

When we later checked into our room, we were surprised that we had been upgraded to a room with a super-king sized bed and beach views! This upgrade also meant access to The Sands beach side restaurant (as opposed to street side) restaurant for buffet breakfast each morning!

The bed was super comfy, the pillow was a little too soft as they use feather pillows. No big deal. The breakfast was out of this world.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Bourneman1971;You have to read this review! Extraordinary Service;This is probably the hardest review I have ever had to write. We came to Bali to spend 6 nights with my father who has lived in Indonesia on and off for the last 32 years. We decided to spend 3 nights at the Discovery Kartika then 3 nights at The Anvaya. After spending 3 nights at Kartika, The Anvaya was quite different, new, more modern but better. The check-in area is modern and chic, service excellent. We had deluxe rooms near the lobby area. The rooms very nice, but smaller than Kartika. Plush, luxurious beds, a small ground floor balcony. Bathroom very nice as well. The Anvaya is deceptive, width it's quite narrow but is very long from the road down to their own small beach. There is lots of trees and shade. It's also unique that has several pools so if you want to do;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

Although the location is in busy Kuta, not far from the airport, once inside the gates it all falls away to the serenity we were hoping for. The lobby area is lovely, the lawns and gardens immaculately maintained. The premiere lagoon pool room we stayed in was very comfortable and perfectly situated. Breakfast selection at The Sands restaurant was amazing. Choice of 3 pools and more than enough sun lounges to go round. The resort is right on the beach which was very handy, especially at sunset. There are 2 restaurants and a pool bar, all well worth a visit. A visit to the spa was very enjoyable and relaxing. There is also a well appointed fitness centre.

Right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Kuta, Anvaya is like the Calm in the Storm. Once you step on the grounds you feel relaxed and a world away from the craziness of the surrounds. We arrived quite late and easily found the our transport (which I’d organised previously through the hotel). Check in was simple and our premier room was every bit as good as it looked on the internet. Housekeeping came through every morning and then in the evening came around again in the evening just to check if we needed anything!

We were installed in a Deluxe Suite (1510) a very spacious room with all the amenities where, apart from receiving a welcome gift during all days offered us a detail to make our stay more pleasant. The hotel’s facilities are perfect from reception or lobby to the different pools, the beatifully manicured gardens, the great acces to the beach (amazing sunset chill out) and the magnificient restaurants (Sands and Kunyit) make this hotel a great place;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;SunLuvingCouple;First time stay, will definitely be back again.;My partner and I stayed here for 10 nights in October and we were very happy with everything this hotel has to offer :) We stayed in a Premier Pool Access Room for a great deal and although it would have been nicer to have some sun lounges on the decking, it was still lovely! Beds were comfy, bathroom facilities great and rooms were kept spotlessly clean. Room was always serviced well and very quickly each day. The breakfast - OMG! We have never experienced such a variety! Absolutely amazing each day knowing you have such a large choice in what to eat.. whether you just want something small, something big or even a different cuisine - it was all there.. including some frozen yoghurt to cleanse the palate :) The best breakfast buffet we have ever experienced in all resorts we;5;0;0;1;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;LMack26;Glorious Tuban Sanctuary;We returned for our second stay at this delightful resort after booking online via email. Check in was smooth and our 2 Premiere Lagoon access rooms were great. My son found the choice at the breakfast buffet unbelievable! A real highlight of staying at this resort along with the nice swimming pools and beautiful gardens. We hired bikes which were in great condition and cycled along the beach pathway. We utilised the departure lounge as we had a late night flight and found the facilities excellent. Look forward to returning again soon.;5;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Jacinta;Highly recommend;Mum and I stayed 12 days at the Anvaya & our only complaint is that we weren’t staying longer! Wonderful hotel in a great location with beautiful grounds & the most friendly and helpful staff you could wish for. ALL the staff went out of their way to say hello & check we had everything we could want. A special birthday surprise was icing on the cake! Special mention to Sueka (guest relations), Hardie, Wayan & Dewa - and all the reception, breakfast, room & pool staff whose names are too many to mention. Hope to see you all next year;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Savanna Peters;Highly Recommend!;"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Anvaya three nights and had an amazing stay. The resort was beautiful, private beach was a nice plus. The staff was incredibly nice; we had multiple staff come up to ask us about our visit and get to know us. The general manager, Sueka, made sure we were having a great stay and made us feel special by remembering our names and going out of his way to say hi throughout our stay. Dewa (also known by his nickname “the Rock”) challenged us to some ping pong and even though he beat us handling, made it a lot of fun! Windu was our server the first night and took care of us the rest of our stay. Those three made our stay special for remembering and interacting with us during the trip! We did feel a little mislead by the website advertising 8 pools;";5;0;0;1;0;0;0

We actually arrived a day late due to a delay with flights and were very upset that we had lost a night at this beautiful hotel (we only had 2 nights booked) the manager on duty Elis came and spoke to us and kindly offered to extend our stay for no extra charge so that we could still stay for 2 nights we paid for after all. What amazing service! Please pass on my appreciation to Elis! Breakfast was busy but good range & quality, great location, pool access rooms are amazing if you can afford with free minibar. Will be back for longer next time. Cannot wait! Thank you Elis!!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

They couldn’t do enough for us. The sunsets were astonishing and were treated as a celebration each evening. Very warm weather made this a fantastic relaxing place to stay.

They also do the touch up in the evening. We trully enjoyed stay here. We also got surprise dessert every evening, but only my room that got extra dessert every night and a saroong. My kids were looking forward every evening to see and taste what dessert they will get. My sister and her husband were also looking forward but never get the dessert. I dont know why?

Our room was in the deluxe area of the hotel and there was a pool access right outside our door. I would choose this category again. All the staff were very kind and respectful. A shout out to Rami in the breakfast buffet area, she was so friendly to us and I felt sad to leave her. Ayin ( a manager), made special arrangements for my friend to have cake at breakfast and while we were at breakfast they decorated our room, it was a special time.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Jose Manuel C;Execellent;Excellent Hotel. We liked a lot the facilities and the service. Specially Erwin and Windu. We had and extraordinary romantic dinner one night carefully prepared. The beach in front of the hotel was amazing with stunning sunset views. Also in the weekends they set a beach club with music and appetizers. We were only annoyed a bit during a couple of days when they hosted a convention of a multinational group. While they cannot be kept accountable for the behavior of those individuals, perhaps they should be more careful with the selection of such events that somehow disturb the peaceful atmosphere. In any case, the place is fully recommendable.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

They saw me from the inside of room, but they were not say anything or just say ""sorry for the inconvenience..."", I guess it would be more appreciated if you could do that.luckily I'm not using the swim suit. 2. When I was having a breakfast, i had alone while my friends still sleeping :)"" I feel very dissapointed, no one can help really help me to keep a table. They cleared up my breakfast and I asked them but their answer was same ""NOT ME"", ""IT WASN'T ME"" but they not assist me to find a solution until I ask ""you should find me a substitute table"", the worst was NO";4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Lorraine M;Fantastic holiday;We got a free upgrade to a suite for our 25th wedding anniversary. From the manager to the bellboys they couldn't do enough for us. Dewi, Ayu, Eka,Itan, and Dewa all went out of their way to make us feel welcome.Would highly recommend a stay here. On the start of Kuta beach. The strip is very busy a but we enjoyed that.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Manda Parker;Bali Vacation 2019;WOW. Our stay at the Anvaya Hotel in Kuta was .....AMAZING, UNFORGETABLE, and PERFECT. The staff are all brilliant they just cant do enough for you. We stayed in 5 hotels in Bali during our vacation and The Anvaya was by far the best. Everything about the hotel was more than 5 star. The room the food the pool, grounds and all employees were just unbelievable. We would come here again undoubtedly. We were so well looked after by Andi and Sueka in particular, thanks guys..... if anyone is traveling to Bali and reading this review....STAY IN THE ANVAYA.... you will not be disappointed.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;jeffrey300;An excellent stay in a perfect hotel a few minutes from Kuta Beach! Recommended!;After my visit in May, this time i stayed with my mother and brother 1 week in The Anvaya Beach Resort (former Santika Beach Resort). What an excellent hotel. Nice and helpful Staff. The rooms are very clean and provided with everything. There are nice and friendly personal at the pool, restaurant Sands, Lobby and front office as well. The breakfast at restaurant Sands is so versatile. There is something delicious for everyone. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0

On a pretty beach (sandy but also lots of shells and coral) and a short walk along beach path to Kuta surfing/swimming area. Very friendly staff. Delicious and fast room service.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Andrew;Great resort, even better location;Of course this hotel is incredibly, modern, and full of all the amenities, but its location and staff are what really make this review a 5/5. The hotel is in the heart of Kuta (but right on the beach). You're incredibly close to all the shopping (high end and bootlegged), restaurants and nightlife, and the beaches. You're also about an hour away from Ubud by car, which may sound like a long way, but if you know Bali traffic, it's a decent commute. What was incredibly surprising about the resort was that it felt like one of the larger ones you'd find in Seminyak due its size, quietness, and access to the beach, but you're in Kuta. But I can't end this review without mentioning the staff. They're incredibly helpful and some of nicest people I've had the pleasure of meeting in a;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;381charlesy;Good service, room needs bit work;Our deluxe room shower cell leaks water and floods the bathroom after each use. General cleanliness and ageing facility needs a little bit of work. The service however, was excellent. I needed a luggage’s valet to my hotel five days later in Nusa Dua while I take a trip in between without them. The concierge service shipped them for me for a reasonable fee. Well coordinated and everything went well. Props!;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Norin M;Excellent Resort;Amazing Resort, beautiful gardens, excellent customer service. The breakfast buffet is the biggest I’ve ever experienced in my life with endless variety of Balinese, Continental and Indian cuisines. Seafood BBQ near the beach at the night brings in the freshest catch of the day to be enjoyed by the guests. Extra added service to your room at dusk a little surprise of a Balinese dessert or drink brought in your room everyday to enjoy. Overall 5 star for us. Will definitely go back with my family.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Jottie40;Fantastic;We have just spent 10 days at the Anvaya, we had a de-luxe room which was very nice. We had a free minibar which was restocked daily, the cleaners who came in did a great job, and we often got back to find our clothes all neatly arranged, the only down side was that the wardrobe was quite small, not enough room for 2 people’s clothes. The breakfast in the sands restaurant was impeccable so much choice, and the waiters and waitresses were all very attentive, nothing was too much trouble, we had a special rapport with Tirtha & Tutu who were always willing to help us with anything, in fact they actually made our holiday we looked forward to seeing them both at breakfast, it’s just lovely to see such friendly smiles first thing in the morning. We spent a lot of time around the pool;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Max Mandias;Vegan-friendly Food, Beautiful Facility & Amazing Service;My experience at Anvaya is very positive. I stayed here for 2 nights. First of all, I am a vegan. When i saw their breakfast selection, I was amazed by the degree of variety. From having soymilk and juice bar to Indian vegetarian foods for breakfast like daal and basmati, I was truly in awe. Compliment to the chefs. They also have Kunyit restaurant for breakfast which spealizes in Indonesian cuisine, i totally missed it, next time will try for sure. I met a lovely lady, she introduced herself as the host of Sands, named Dayu. Had a great chat, very welcoming and warm. Next, i bought a lot of wooden trays which i needed to pack to be plane-ready. The staff named Agung at the front, helped packing all my stuff, with all the cartboard and wrapped it nicely. Overall, very;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;janpiro;Even better than before;We previously stayed at the wonderful Anvaya in February in a Premier Pool View Room and this time (September) we booked Premier Lagoon Access Rooms. There were 7 of us in our party in 4 rooms and 3 were first timers to Bali. We all had an amazing holiday thanks to the Anvaya and their lovely staff. Our second stay sealed the deal ... this is our Bali family and and our Bali home. I love the location being right on the beach and within walking distance to everything you could wish for - Discovery Mall, Lipo Mall, Waterbom Park, spas, money changers, laundry service and loads of great restaurants. We all loved the Lagoon Access rooms and I'm forever spoiled for anything less. The rooms are all very clean and relaxing with a huge comfortable bed good water pressure and aircon.;5;0;1;0;1;0;1

I was not disappointed! The staff were amazing, breakfast was awesome with beautiful views over looking a calm ocean. I had a lovely Premiere Lagoon room, just a step out of the sliding doors into the private pool backing on to the rooms. The resort is in a garden setting which also added to it's ambience.

I have never stayed anywhere that has such nice staff, that really try hard to make you stay as comfortable and happy as they can.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Mimpi_Indah_10;Outstanding again!;My wife and I visited the Anvaya Beach Resort Bali for in total 29 nights in July and August 2019 with a two-week break in Java in between. We stayed in a well-equipped Premiere Room and when our daughter joined us during the last week of our holidays we moved to a Deluxe Suite. In 2018 we also stayed at this hotel and before that we frequented the Santika Premiere Hotel (previous hotel at the same location) multiple times. The many positive reviews on TA very well point out what the beachfront resort has to offer in terms of its facilities, services and location. In that sense the exclusive property is very well appointed, however the staff, in taking pride in what they do, truly make this for us special place what it is.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

She gave us a special offer for the upgrade for the premiere room instead of the deluxe room. The premiere room with every day free minibar and we could have the breakfast also in both restaurants (Sands & Kunyit). Daily you get specialities like pastries and fruits included free water in your room. The rooms are so nice and clean, daily twice cleand.

We were greeted with a smile and a drink in reception and told we had been upgraded to the whirlpool suite as it was our honeymoon. Anthony the duty manager showed us to the room and what a room it was! HUGE bed, private pool, massive bathroom with so much space and luxury. Anthony was helpful and gave some good advice for our stay in Bali. The breakfast was good although they could definitely add some hash browns to breakfast to make it go from good to excellent.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;ttarnz17;Beautiful place to stay;We had ordered 2 rooms as there were supposed to be four of us on our trip, however it ended up with 3 of us. We had asked for adjoining rooms but ended up getting 2 separate rooms which was a little bit dumb. We brought this to the attention of the hotel staff and they did their best for us, shifting us after one night to poolside rooms that we could access from each others sliding doors. The rooms, furnishings and the whole hotel is lovely. We were upgraded to eating brekkie at the Sands. Both restaurants have lovely brekkies but the Sands (beachside) is a lovely place to eat, with lovely food. The staff are all lovely, polite and work hard. The cleaners, mainly young male that I saw, all do a wonderful job. I'd recommend this accommodation. It's close to shopping, eateries;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

After check in we were shown to our favorite Premier Lagoon Room #2126 which is perfect. Beautiful room. large comfortable bed, super cold airconditioning and a deck that leads to the lagoon pool. Do yourself a favour and book this room type if you can, you definitely won't regret it. The gardens are immaculate and the pools are amazing, never any issue in trying to find a sun lounge for the day. The beach is spectacular and also has a live DJ on some nights where you can sit, chill out and watch the beautiful sunset. Breakfast;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

This hotel is not in my favourite location as i like to stay more North like Legian. My room was a South facing room on the South side at the back of the hotel. So facing the airport and near the pool / beach and i was still a very quiet room. I did get upgraded from the Deluxe room to the Premier room and this was awesome. The Premier room has a sliding panel so you can get to the hand basin in the bathroom from the bedroom. This was handy as i had friends over for drinks and I didnt have to leave the room all the time to rinse out glasses.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Eliska03;Resort on Kuta with beach access;I booked last two nights in Bali with my niece at Anvaya. After reading some reviews, I decided to ask for upgrade to premium room upon check-in. They had luckily last premium room available for surcharge of 400.000 IDR, which I thought was ok to pay for more comfort. Unfortunately, the room was “garden view”, which meant no view at all, there were just tall banana leaves in front of the balcony (or other plant). The room had everything that you expect in 5* resort, especially we liked their specious bathroom. Otherwise the room itself was not that special, apart from a huge king size bed. Minuses for the room that we minded were: - bad entrance door - you can hear everything that goes on in the hall and the first night we were woken up around 1 am by later arriving guests - AC;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Breakfast spread is huge and has options for all, including Indian vegetarian options. I also saw Jain options available for breakfast at their Kunyit restaurant. Sands restaurants is a perfect place to witness sunset while sipping on some cocktails and chilled Bintang. It also gives direct access to part of Kuta beach which is very clean.

Breakfast had excellent choice for everyone and was extremely well run and staff were efficient. Rooms were clean, not forgetting the sink and taps. My only disappointment was poor cupboard hanging space, but that's a small complaint and one easily managed if you know beforehand. Overall would like to compliment the management on a wonderful hotel and fabulous staff. Very pretty gardens, beach setting etc., Oh and the Squishy pillows were awesome.;5;0;0;1;1;1;1

Apart from being multilingual ,Dewa knows all there is to know about Bali, he is very knowledgable and we had a great laugh with him during our stay. Hope to get back in the near future. Exceptional experience...... Thank you, Regards, Anne and Andy.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0

Public relations manager, Suekha, thank you for making Sim's birthday a special one with cake, decor and singing it with us with your staff at the breakfast table. Also, your guidance into Bailnese culture and values was an eye opener for our family. The leaders like you have created a happy, hardworking and cheerful team.

Kids club is also new and modern. Quite a few options for pools. Staff:- what can I say, I can rate staff of Anvaya the best in Bali. I like to thank Mr. Sueka, Mr. Antony (front office manager) and Miss Ayin for making our stay comfortable and enjoyable. Friendly and did everything to make us feel comfortable.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;MellyF75;Very Good Hotel But A Little Disappointed;We are currently partway into our 7 day stay at this hotel having previously stayed 7 nights at the Hotel Indigo in Seminyak. Whilst the ANVAYA is a lovely modern hotel, well located with good facilities, we realise we’ve been truly spoilt at the Hotel Indigo. Both are classed as 5 star properties yet the same attention to detail is lacking at the ANVAYA. We arrived and were checked in efficiently and taken to our Premier room. Rooms are quite cramped for 2 adults and a rollaway bed for our son, clean enough but very dark with not much natural light coming into the room. The bathroom configuration is odd with the toilet in the middle of the wardrobe/luggage storage area and not partitioned. We are on the 5th floor overlooking the hotel next door and a service area so despite;4;0;1;0;1;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Liz B;An oasis in Kuta;The atmosphere of the Anvaya is bliss - it is luxurious, modern and calm. The customer service, rooms and restaurants are all incredible. We had an amazing stay and recommend this hotel highly. The hotel is located conveniently close to the airport so it was a quick drive after a long flight. The street where the main entrance to the hotel is located (Jl. Kartika Plaza) is exactly what people had warned us Kuta would be like. It is a chaotic jumble of sports bars and souvenir shops. But as soon as you walk into the hotel, you are transported to an oasis. The hotel’s buildings and grounds are serene and perfect for a relaxing holiday. We had lovely times at the pool and appreciated that the hotel provides floating lounges to relax on. The pool closest to the beach has a great;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Breakfast is amazing, if people moan about the food they must be crazy.... Pool was always fairly quiet always sun beds available any time of the day... 15/20 minute walk along the boardwalk to the main beach area, great place for a few beers during the day or for sunset watching the surfers 30,000 rupiahs for a Bintang every little bar is the same price All the staff were so friendly, we were there when the was an earth tremor, the staff were so calm;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Shalini;Beautiful;Its a stunning property on Kuta beach near the International Airport. Though the resort is beautiful but we got screwed over by our travel agent and couldn't get the oceanfront suites. If you want a good view please confirm with the hotel from the start, as the premier room that we stayed in had no view at all inspite of being a beach front property. The rooms were absolutely clean, the staff was friendly, the food was good but if you are looking for Indian cuisine, you will have to look for other restaurants nearby. The hotel has a private beach and a main pool.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Ayin Purwati Assistant Resort/Service manager was always available and extremely helpful. Her memories for names was impressive. The premier room was outstanding and served our needs, clean, modern and serviced twice daily. The breakfast was the best quality selection of food I've seen in all our travels.

Our room was not, and the pool was too cold. We ended up using the main pool because it was much warmer. The breakfast buffet was massive.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

I have stayed all over the globe in some of the most renowned hotels and I found the genuine care from the entire team at the Anvaya to be world class. Example: I left an iPad and Bose speakers in my taxi to the airport and the staff at the hotel tracked down the taxi and arranged for them to be posted back to me in Australia. I couldn’t of asked for more. The buffet breakfast was also the best of the best, you really need to experience if for yourself. Summary, exceeded my expectation in all areas. A true 5 star experience. See you next time Anvaya!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

He provided us with many recommendations and cultural lessons during our stay and was very fun to talk with. Each of the staff members were friendly and knowledgable. The resort is beautiful and meticulously clean. The breakfast buffet was phenomenal with so many options to choose from. The pools are gorgeous and the private beach is very nice! We got a great (and inexpensive) massage from a local on the beach named Lucy. The location of the resort is very convenient, as it sits near the airport and between several areas of interest.

We were celebrating my birthday and had booked a Premier Room. The kids were upgraded from the Deluxe Room they had booked to a Premier room so they could be in a room close to us. We really appreciated this upgrade. Thanks especially to Andi for keeping in touch before we arrived and also for organizing our complimentary pick ups from the airport when there was some confusion as to whether this was included in our package. Nothing was a problem here. Our room rate included breakfast at the Sands Restaurant which overlooked both the beach and the pool area.

Not only is Bali awesome, but the Anvaya Resort was OUTSTANDING. It is right on the beach, our room had a beautiful view, was so clean, the staff could have not been more genuinely helpful, breakfast buffet (included) was the widest array of food you could ever imagine (& delicious) & the location was quiet, yet so close to all that Bali had to offer.

Had a deluxe pool access room which was very nice but very far from the beach and the main pool (though the building has its own pool, I still prefer the more lively main pool) had to cross the lobby and walked pretty far back and forth. Love the bathroom amenities. Breakfast not bad, can do better on wider food variety. Still remember the friendly bellman Putu. And they definitely need to increase security system, only had me checked at the car gate, none of us entering lobby being searched. Let’s be alert, shall we?;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

The room was a good size, bright, nicely decorated, with strong air conditioning and wifi. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was also large and a sliding door opened up the sink area to the bedroom, the balcony and the view beyond. A nice touch. Shower area was a good size and it’s always great when shower water does not go to the bathroom floor - much appreciated! We booked a premiere room and they had some complimentary drinks (in addition to bottled water) and that was great, too. The hotel offers a wonderful breakfast buffet with many choices.

Everything is above and beyond fantastic. The staff are always so attentive and on hand to assist in any way they can, they are a credit to the hotel. The food is great, the breakfast is outstanding whether you dine at The Sands or The Kunyit. The beds and pillows are so comfortable and the resort is spotless. This time we had a medical issue and the staff (especially Erwin) had the situation sorted very quickly. A big thank you to Dewi, Ayin and everyone who always makes our stays so memorable.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;David B;Anvaya is a GREAT landing pad!;This is the perfect hotel for arrival in Bali! My flight pulled in about 1am. I had arranged a pickup via the hotel and everything went according to plan. The bet part was the hotel was very close allowing me to slip into a very comfy bed and premium linen sheets ASAP. I spent 2 nights there before heading up to Ubud and it was perfect. The breakfast buffet was great and the dinner was delicious, too. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely reccommend the Anvaya Resort.;4;0;0;1;0;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;BHoo1;Good for the price;I booked two nights at the Anvaya in the most basic room because it was close to the airport and reasonably priced for a five star hotel. We arrived very late (2AM) at the hotel. Although we booked a single king bed, they gave us two single beds in the premier room (upgraded us) which we were very happy with. They had staff to help us push the beds together and the bed was then huge! As it was very late at night, staff to come up to push the beds and bring additional bathroom amenities were a bit slow and no one would pick up the call at reception so I had to go downstairs which was understandable as it was late at night, but would be better if they were more responsive 24/7... I did not realise, but only premier rooms or better can visit the Sands restaurant for breakfast;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Loved that it’s right on the beach but also a short walk to the main Kuta strip. The beach was beautiful and the Sands restaurant was overlooking the beach, absolutely stunning at sunset. I loved the free 2 hour activities each afternoon with lovely staff. The wood carving with Komang was very peaceful and he was very friendly and helpful. The egg or canvas painting was also fun.

For the standard rooms it’s another restaurant. It’s definitely worth upgrading! The room was amazing. Relaxing. Nice design. Attention to details. Nothing has been left out. Even an insect repellent spray was there. The pools are very nice. The private beach is a bonus. Excellent food. Excellent cocktails. Happy hour from 1-4pm.

Breakfast (best food selection EVER) Service (would give it 9.5 out of 10 if we could) Dinner beautiful and wine selection nice and not expensive( which is hard to find in Bali) Rooms (beautiful)- would recommend upgrading from standard as your mini bar is free each day (no alcohol), JUST AMAZING So a huge thank you again and best wishes;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

We booked a premier room at the beach area of the resort and asked for an upgrade to a lagoon room. They were able to accommodate us for only $20 per night extra. Worth every cent. Truly stunning. Best beachside resort I have stayed. Pool area.. stunning. Clean, loads of lounges including beach lounges. Breakfast.

We upgraded to the lagoon access which was worth every penny. From the moment, we arrived in the hotel, we felt welcome. I’m not a morning person, but breakfast every morning changed that. They had a buffet, with almost anything you could possibly want, continental, full English, healthy, Indian, Balinese, etc.. Finally, I want to say that the staff here are second to none, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM made me feel special, very attentive if needed, extremely polite. My girlfriend and I have made a pledge to come back every year. Special shout out to Suwantika, who I feel like I’ve made a lifelong friend with. Look forward to seeing you all again!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

The room was spacious and well appointed. Every person who worked at the resort was more than happy to help and assist. The spa was also fantastic.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;SummerChaser;Great resort in Kuta;We stayed for 5 nights in a 2 bedroom family room and really enjoyed our stay. We were told the hotel was at 90% occupancy while we were there and it did feel busy if we were a little later in the morning for the breakfast buffet, but otherwise good. Always got a pool lounge no problem and the service was always prompt. I’ve been coming to Bali for 20 years and I have to say that Kuta beach is currently the most beautiful I’ve seen it, most likely due to the governments recent ban on single use plastics. The private beach at Anvaya is beautiful, clean and a great spot to spend the day. Our kids enjoyed the kids club but compared to other resorts it was a little small and they got a bit bored with it by the end. Location is great right near Waterbom Bali, shopping centres, art;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

While I was there I met a very charming lady by the name of Dewi Cakra who then showed me around the property. On my next trip to Bali I will definitely book this hotel and stay there.

Delighted with our stay;As a first time visitor to Bali I couldn't be happier with my choice of hotel/resort in Kuta. Despite being only 1.4km from the airport and right on the main road, we found the Anvaya to be a haven of peace and beauty. We appreciated the warm welcome and friendliness of the staff, the elegance of the architecture and the beauty of the gardens and pools. We found the location to be ideal for us, with plenty if restaurants just out the front gate, and the heart of Kuta a 15 to 20 minute walk down the beach or along the main road. The room was smart, clean and comfortable, and we both slept well on the king size bed!

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;mikaela h;Great hotel, I would really recommend this place.;Me and my boyfriend are currently staying at the Anvaya beach resort in one of the Deluxe rooms. My first impression overlooking the lobby is ‘what an oasis’, it’s so calm and quite in this hotel after coming in from the busy streets of Kuta. The room is big enough with a great bathroom/toilet. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all people who is planning to visit Kuta, we couldn’t be any happier that we choose for this hotel. -The main pool area is spacious and very clean with waiters that’s helping you with food/drink orders during the day. The main pool area also has a direct access to the beach and provide you with beach towels. -The ‘small’ pool area, which we’re overlooking from our room looks great and calmer than the bigger area. -Breakfast in the morning;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;emmanuelthamrin;Everything ok must learn how to serve from the heart;This is my 3rd times stay here. For breakfast this hotel has huge selecetion from local traditional such as nasi goreng opor ayam telur balado, japanese, chinese india pizza lots of food. Anvaya has 3 swimming pools and private beach. But I feel the staff is not too friendly compare the others 5star hotel I just stayed with. Maybe Anvaya must learn from Indigo Bali Hotel Seminyak how to serve the client from the heart. Today when I want to chek out, I'm standing almost 12 minuite until staff name Eka ask me anything she can help. While other staff just walking around like nobody around the lobby area. In Indigo hotel.. every staff try to serve and give smile to the client when they see the client look confuse or dont know where to go.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Ritazell;Impressive;"An impressive lobby area. our ground floor room was smaller than I expected for that class of hotel, but nice bathroom, towels, toiletries etc., just a couple of steps from one of the large pools. I found the breakfast to be excellent, with very large variety of food, and drinks, and it even had some decent coffee. Their restaurant ""Sands"" by the beach has a daily seafood BBQ which was good. Just outside the hotel there are numerous restaurants, many with live music. A bit further down the road is a Mall with a very large supermarket. As in most places in Bali, the hotel staff was welcoming and friendly. But in their breakfast restaurant we felt that we received extra special attention, which was appreciated.";5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Yogesh Srivastava;Nice property at beach;Anvaya Hotel and Beach Resort is located just at Kuta beach .

Nice place to unwind at beach with friends and family. It has good swimming pool as well. Restaurant is overlooking sea. Insist on sea view rooms. Recommended for stay with family and friends.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Chantelle T;Beautiful hotel, never wanted to leave;From the moment we were picked up from the airport this hotel exceeded our expectations! The pick-up was well organised and the driver was informative and friendly. The check-in was smooth and staff were very accommodating. We arrived early and were given access to the departure lounge and also another room which had free snacks. The lobby is beautiful with so many water features and displays the Balinese style so well. The staff are all dressed immaculately too. The rooms are very nice with a huge bed. Pool areas and restaurant were so lively, lots of areas to relax. We tried both restaurants and both were great. The breakfast deserves an award. It was the most amazing thing I’d ever seen! It had anything you can think of for a dinner buffet let alone a breakfast. Staff;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Kelvin D;Real life Paradise!;It was my second trip to Bali and I remember on my first trip back in 2017 seeing this place from the beachside and wanted to stay there if ever I came back. Come April 2019 and it happened! Oh boy was this the BEST resort I had ever stayed! Facilities were top notch! Great and I mean GREAT customer service! Everyday they would bring complimentary snacks and sweets. The pools (because there are 3 to choose from) are a great place to chill and the daily activities they run are AWESOME! I have already booked my next stay this coming September and most likely again next year. I highly HIGHLY recommend!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Troy S;Fantastic place to stay;Stayed at the Anvaya Beach Resort June 2019 and loved every minute from the moment we arrived to the time that we sadly had to leave. To say the service it better than excellent is a complete understatement. Even though located in the busy Kuta district once you enter the resort you are taken away from the hustle bustle of the busy area. Relaxed. The staff here are well above amazing to say the least and I have never received service to the standard provided here. Special mention to Sawantika in the Sands Restaurant and Rian at reception. These 2 staff members are to be congratulated for the extra efforts they went to in order to make our holiday special, truely amazing. Thank you guys! The property is beautiful, well maintained and extremely clean.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Snowboard_Scuba;A home away from home;Flying to Bali is a long way to go from the east coast of the US. We landed early and our room was not yet ready so we were invited to enjoy the enclosed waiting lounge complete with showers. Once the room was ready (early....thank you!), we had a quick tour of the room's features, dropped our luggage and headed off to the pool. Which one? There are 4 main pools and a few wading-type pools. We chose the pool closest to the beautiful beach. The staff: All the staff were extremely accommodating, attentive and helpful. I wish that I could list and thank every employee that I encountered at the Anvaya. However, huge shoutouts to Dewi, Ayin, Putu, Anom Ironman and Indah!

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Marge T;A memorable experience for a first-timer in Bali.;We stayed here for nine days and even when we went to Ubud for two days/ two nights we didn't check out. Our room is on the third floor with a balcony overlooking one of the swimming pools in the property. The rooms are well-maintained and they always put something to nibble when you get hungry in the middle of the night. They have a complete set of toiletries and usually, I don't use the shower gel, shampoo and conditioner provided by the hotels because it doesn't smell good but theirs is an exception. The bed is super comfy and the pillows are perfect for me. I slept well the whole time we were there. I also enjoyed the buffet breakfast at Kunyit restaurant and the romantic dinner at the Sands, both restaurants served good food choices. They also have different performances;5;0;0;0;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Moon K;The Anvaya Beach Resort: a luxurious experience.;This resort is landscaped beautifully with trees and water and many pools to choose from. It is a lovely experience and the staff goes out of their way to make you comfortable. Their rooms with a private pool are stunning. They have a massive breakfast with “stations” of food from every part of the world....European, Indian, Asian, Indonesian, Balinese, etc. ....can be overwhelming in the choices!

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Mario;Excellent hotel & service;Me and my buddy spent 8 nights in the Anvaya hotel and right on from the beginning everything was perfect. We experienced a very warm welcome and enjoyed our stay from the first minute on. The hotel offers a very cosy atmosphere with nice swimming pools, palm trees and an own area at the beach were we enjoyed the typical beautiful sunsets in Bali. The breakfast was very good with a huge variety of food and fresh juices. The spa area was really nice and the massages were outstanding. What made our stay even more perfect was the friendliness of the hotel employees, doesn‘t matter if room service, reception, breakfast, taxi service (thank you Wayan) or service staff at the pool. Everybody took great care of us and always has a smile on their face. We also had great conversations;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Janep0303;Such an Amazing Hotel!;We recently had 5 nights at the Anvaya and loved every minute! It is just far enough out of Kuta but easy walking distance to Discovery Mall either along the beach or the road. The staff are amazing and so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast at The Sands is one of the best we have ever experienced. The beds are SO comfortable and they have thought of everything to make the stay enjoyable. It was unusual having the wardrobe in the bathroom area, but quickly got used to that. Hotel has a casual atmosphere with fantastic service and a beautiful location right on the beach. We don't normally have meals in the hotels we stay in but did try the Kunyit Restaurant which was traditional Indonesian food. WOW! It was such an amazing experience, the food was;5;0;0;1;0;0;1

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Xavier B;Amazing place;The hotel might not be located in the most vibrant part of Bali but it is amazing. It is obviously super clean and well maintained but the rooms are really charming, having their own balcony. The pools are huge and everywhere and the beach is beautiful and not crowded. Above all, the staff is super attentive and caring, always looking to help and genuinely caring for your stay to be perfect. Maybe the hotel should create a “kids only” pool to ensure the tranquility of couples or single travelers but for the rest, a happy 5 on 5 score. The hotel restaurant Kuniyt and the Spa also scores a five star rating.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Jolee262;Paradise within paradise!;A return to a very cold Melbourne winter leaves me longing for our warm relaxed days at The Anvaya. Breakfast is the most amazing experience that leaves you wanting for nothing. Tirtha was a wonderful hostess who paid us a visit each morning enjoyed at The Sands. All staff were so friendly and courteous and it was a great way to start each day. We also enjoyed the amazing Indonesian food at Kunyit on several occaisions and have been inspired to try a few recipes of my own. Andi from Front Office ensured our stay was perfect and our beautiful room was a true oasis. Our plunge pool and lounge area were welcome relief from the heat of the day. The room itself is beautifully styled and the bathroom... wow! We booked our next stay before we left and now will be counting down;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;David W;Best Breakfast in Bali;We stayed at the Anvaya May 8-16, 2019, We Booked a Premium room which was really lovely with a great balcony, the room was very comfortable although could do with some more space for Clothes, but Fabulous room. The Pool area is really good and made very enjoyable by the staff headed by Dewa, very comfortable and lots of shade and plenty of beds. Our room entitled dining in the Sands restaurant for breakfast and it was amazing, I would say the best breakfast in Bali, service is superb. I would suggest the Hotel needs a Bar or Pool bar to give guests the opportunity to interact, but a super resort.;4;0;0;1;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Robert Trewin;Wonderful Service;"We thought we would spoil ourselves. Originally booked the ""Ocean Front Villa"" and had been excited about staying here. When we turned up the room was not ready. Whilst we waited they offered us a free BBQ Seafood dinner and drinks whilst our room was made ready. We then got upgraded us to a whirlpool suite and explained that they had an error in their booking system due to renovations to be completed next door to the original room. We accepted this explanation that was handled extremely well by Andi. The room was amazing. The resort is amazing. Andi did everything to ensure we were happy with the rest of our stay.

The entrance is very grand and immediately gives the feel of a 5* establishment. The staff is very friendly and check in was a breeze, we were also upgraded free of cost. The rooms and spacious, tastefully decorated and well equipped. The pool area is stunning and kept very clean, leaves barely on the ground before being hastily swept up.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Kevin G;Anvaya Kuta Bali May 2019.;By far one of the best hotels we have had the joy of staying in during the many stays in Bali. From first arriving we were made to feel welcome and may I say after nine wonderful days did not wish to leave. Could not fault staff from reception thru to room attendants, waiters and pool attendants but a special thank you must go to Suartana at the Sands Restaurant for making our many evening dinners even more enjoyable, Will without doubt be returning,and once again,thank you Anvaya.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Celestar989;Above Average with Room for Improvement;Stayed here for 3 nights in their lowest category Deluxe room in May-19. After reading so many 5 stars reviews on TA, I had high expectations. In my opinion, the resort scores well in terms of hospitality. Many employees I met from waiters at Kunyit to front desk were friendly. Breakfast at Kunyit had good variety with great emphasis on local Balinese food and good selection of coffee. So if you are looking for bacon and hashbrown for breakfast, this is not the place for you. Note that guests staying at their lowest category room gets breakfast only at Kunyit and not at Sands which is disappointing. Reason given is that Kunyit is closer to the Deluxe rooms than Sands but I actually do not mind walking to Sands for breakfast once in awhile. Will be good if Management states this;4;0;0;1;0;0;0

The resort was beautiful, breakfast has wide selection of fruit (I'm on clean eating diet). unfortunately the receptionist inform me to have breakfast at front part of the hotel while I can have breakfast on the other restaurant by the beach. I asked for crab soup (balinese style) on barbeque night and it tasted delicious. The room was clean but only has standing shower for deluxe room type. I expected for bathtub.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Brian M;Fabulous end to a holiday;We stayed for 2 nights after 10 days at the Hyatt Regency in Sunur and we have to say we that we where more than surprised to find another resort that had the same high standards as the Hyatt. From the easy check in and given a room to use as our lagoon pool room was not ready, there is a lounge with complimentary beverages and great snacks until your room is ready. We dined in the Sands restaurant on the first night and from the service and the food it was faultless. The breakfast is amazing with so many dishes to choose from, you will not be disappointed. The staff are excellent, always smiling and very polite and attentive. Thank you so much to Ayin who assisted us we check in.

The hotel location is right by the beach and has 2 pools of which I personally preferred the larger one closest to beach. Rooms are clean and airy with all the facilities you could want. I would not hesitate coming back here in an instant! Breakfast in the Kunyit Bali restaurant was made even more pleasurable by Fitri and May who welcomed you each morning like family. They both went out of there way to make sure you had a great breakfast and I feel they deserve a special mention. One thing I would say about Bali - you either love it or hate it.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Air conditioning was also lovely and the white marble in the bathroom gave it a touch of luxury. We also had breakfast included and the selection available was impressive, and the seafood bbq in the evening was a great way to end the day.

Breakfast was the biggest selection I’ve ever seen at a hotel, with everything from ice cream to chicken kebab, as well as all the normal breakfast options.

The room was clean and spacious with plenty of seating including a daybed ( which my teenage daughter claimed as her bed). The bathroom was very spacious with a double shower, separate toilet, double vanities and a bath with a TV to watch. Every night we had a turn down service and staff left us little treats to eat. As part of the villas we had a complementary afternoon tea served every at 3 by the villas main pool which overlook the beach.with a tempting selection of sweet and savory treats.

Between 5-7 they have barbecue on the beach and a dj playing nice tunes to the sunset. If you go out from the hotel you are right on the main street with shopping and restaurants. The pool area is very good and there is many sunbeds. The only thing that disappointed me is that the pool in the picture on hotels.com that is closest to the beach is only for those who stay in the villas.

There was yoga in the mornings and nice relaxing music played in the pool area. Location is perfect on the beach and only a 10 min walk to shops, cafes etc and markets and waterbom park.

Went for breakfast on the restaurant at the beach and you can get your delicious breakie with such beach/pool view. They have plenty menus, but i only tried their eggs because im still on diet. You should try their cappuccino, it tasted great and they give you for free. The location are very strategic, when you order online transportation, it will arrived in a minute.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Mick D;Great place to stay in Kuta;Went for trip to Bali on my partner b’day and ens up extending for another two days. We upgraded to lagoon access room and loved swimming in our private area with glass of wine. Resort has beach at the back, one of Anvaya restaurant is next to beach which is an amazing view while having food and watching sea. We loved our aqua aerobics session which was free and fun.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;JaraNL;Pleasantly surprised;Hotel is located near to airport and near to a shopping mall, in fact two shopping malls. Near the hotel are many restaurants. Hotel is modern and clean. Personnel is friendly and always helpful. Swimming pools are clean and there are plenty of beds, either in the shadow or in the sun. Breakfast is really perfect, enormous choice of food from different countries, inclusive Indonesian cuisine. The fresh juice bar is delicious. Rooms are modern and also very clean. Food in hotel is good and surprisingly not overpriced, which is often the case in such hotels. If we will visit Kuta, we will certainly book this hotel (4+ stars) again.;4;0;1;0;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Gaurav Nemani;Cozy, comfortable and blissful. a must stay;We stayed at the Anvaya Beach resort for our honeymoon. The property is located very close to the airport and the free pick-up was really helpful. The room was very comfortable and cozy. The breakfast buffet had a wide range of both Indonesian and western dishes. We were spoilt for choices as everything tasted authentic and fresh. The view from the restaurant was excellent, we ended up spending hours in the pool and the beach. The hotel staff was very helpful and we loved our stay. Will definitely be visiting them again!;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;GVGH1;Relaxing family holiday at the Anvaya Beach resort;We have just returned from a Bali family holiday staying at the Anvaya. We had a great experience. The staff are friendly and attentive and the rooms are clean. The breakfast spread was incredible and catered to everyone. Fantastic swimming pools with great pool side service. Regular activities at hand including yoga and water aerobics. Situated on the beach, close to shops and restaurants. We would definitely go back.;5;0;1;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;adelaide69;WOW, JUST WOW!;This is now my favourite hotel/resort in Bali! The amazing staff, the food, the views, the pools, the rooms, the location! there isn't much to complain about when you arrive at the Anvaya Resort. We had an amazing room just metres from the breakfast area, which is sea front. Our room was right next to the pools, but also just moments from the front reception. I ate a meal at the resort which was less than great (it was supposed to be snapper...it was not), which I then returned to the kitchen saying I would eat the mash and vegetables if they would just take off the fish. They took ages to return my plate of food, and just when I was getting irritated, a waiter brought me a clean, fresh plate of mash and vegies. then when the bill came, he told me that the dish had been deleted;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;dechen barfungpa;Magical Bali;It was indeed one of the best properties I’ve ever stayed in. I visited Bali in March 2018 and my stay at The Anvaya beach Resort was nothing but heavenly. From The swimming pools to the rooms, it was all lovely. We were taken care of in a really nice way. And the staff, helpful as ever. Definitely the best place to stay if you’re looking for a relaxed time in Bali. The location is also very good and was easy shopping for souvenirs and money exchanges are just few steps away from the hotel. All in all, it was a relaxing holiday, just what I was looking for. Thankyou to all the staff for making my stay a memorable one.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;nicoled;GREAT STAY!!!!;We stayed here for 7 nights and from the moment we checked in we started our holiday, we were shown to arrival/departure lounge which had a selection on drinks and canapes. when we got to our room we were amazed. the room was very clean and spacious, the bathroom was also very big with hot water and good pressure, we had a lagoon room would recommend as you pretty much have a pool outside your door.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Mr. R;Do NOT stay here;DO NOT STAY HERE seriously. IF YOU DO you would NOT want to leave ever...😄. This place is one of the best or dare i say the best hotel/resort that i have stayed at. The service here is top notch amazing staffs that make you feel extremely welcomed and cared for, very high standards of service, Everyone is friendly and helpful 24/7 Service for sure. The rooms, restaurants and the facilities are also amazing rooms are updated(modern) and clean the breakfast at sands was incredible quite a lot of varieties to choose from, American, indian, japanese and Indonesian cuisines are available those that are Gluten intolerant can even request a gluten free bread. However i do recommend coming earlier when it isn't too crowded cause service tends to get a bit slow as it gets busier.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;John De Ceglie;Outstanding;We are staying at the anvaya now. We have booked 2X lagoon access rooms. From check in i have never experienced anything like this hotel. Every single staff member here is friendly and go out of their way for you and speak great English. The rooms are outstanding and are clean. Beds are all comfortable, shower pressure is very good. Breakfast is unbelievable they have literally everything you could possibly ask for. I have booked 3 rooms in September we enjoyed our stay so much. A big thanks to Sandy in the Restaurant and pool for the great service. AYIN and Dewi thanks very much for all your help to ensure our rooms exceeding our expectations. I have never experienced hospitality like yours thank you so much;5;0;0;1;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;TheChocolateFalls;Fantastic staff and service;Dear Hotel Management/dewa As I wrap up this journey which has been engraved in our hearts I have to also wrap up this final night of mine with a huge heartfelt thank you for such an outstanding stay and service that we were provided here. It is emotional to think that we won’t be seeing such fantastic KIND HEARTED STAFF that you have in this hotel who work tirelessly day and night in this heat to provide an unforgettable guest experience to me and my family and I am sure to everyone else but I know they will do extremely well in the careers if they carry on the way they are at the moment. I always make friends with hotel staff who treat us like family and have many on my Facebook from my stay in other hotels just so we can keep in touch and is alway pleasing to see them;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;robin a;Nice place to be in;It is really a very nice to be here. Located in the middle of market. When we talk about the food it is not that good. Staff is very cooperative. Spa services are good. In the end I will give 4/5 overall.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;GMMapungubwe;A cut ABOVE the REST;My first visit to Bali after travelling the world for 15 years.... Being a hotel general manager myself the only thing i can say is WoW... From the minute we were picked up at the airport by Oky the driver to ariving at the hotel where Rian checked us in at reception... it was my birthday on the 11th of April and was really surprised when Demi and some of her staff came over to sing happy birthday, keep in mind no mention was made to them that it is my birthday... not to mention the turn down service we got in the room. One can go on for hours how great the service was and how friendly the staff is, but if i can say it in 3 words it would be Service by Design... Keep up the good work and level of service and will be back again next year in April... still so much left to see;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Famof3inaRV;Dinner at the sands;We visited the Sands Restaurant for dinner on our recent visit to Bali in April 2019, the food was fantastic- my husband had the BBQ seafood - grilled snapper- cooked to perfection!my daughter (5yrs) had pasta carbonara and I had grilled chicken with vegetables- all delicious meals. A family friendly restaurant with great service. Would definitely return.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Constance B;An oasis in the craziness of Kuta;"My husband and I spent nine nights at The Anvaya Beach Resort Bali. We opted to stay there for our entire visit and did three tours with local guides in order to experience other parts of Bali. Kuta is a much busier area than we would normally choose to stay, but the Anvaya was a lovely retreat. The Balinese decor and ambiance transport you into a relaxing environment with a large and welcoming lobby area, beautiful pools (including a smaller one that's quiet and more private), and two excellent restaurants, one of which features a seafood buffet where you can choose your catch and eat it freshly grilled. The resort is immaculately clean and well maintained with ""Western standard"" rooms, a/c, beds, showers, and wifi. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful.";5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Kevin T;Highly Recommended;This hotel is absolutely stunning! The hotel is well situated on the quieter end of Kuta yet in walking distance to the hustle and bustle. The pools are amazing - there is also a very nice private beach within the hotel - probably the cleanest we experienced in Kuta. Over and above the lovely hotel ground, the staff are amazing. In particular, Ayin, went above and beyond to make our stay one to remember - thank you! We will certainly be back. We have traveled extensively in Thailand / Indonesia and this was one of the best hotels we had the privilege of staying at.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Ali Zghoul;Honeymoon vacation;I would recommend The Anvaya Beach Resort as your accommodation during your visit to Bali due to its location. What's more, they have delicious food, very friendly staff, spacious rooms, very tidy and hygienic. I enjoyed my stay over there for 4 days with no single comment on their services.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Ireneb;Amazing!!!;This hotel is beyond amazing. All the staff are so friendly and helpful, hotel is clean and beautifully decorated.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Dvn S;For Indians Specially;Indian vegetarians staying here do not rely on the breakfast as the breakfast is depressing here. Do carry some cup noodles and soup packets for managing breakfast. It is a beautiful property with a beach view. Very well maintained. the premium rooms are very very small and not comfortable for 3 people. for two it is fine. The beach is pretty clean and has a beautiful view. The pool is very clean and well maintained. Beautifully maintained hotel in modern architecture. Food for vegetarians is a challenge tho.;4;0;0;0;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Wayno;Great relaxing Resort;This hotel is Amazing, you will feel like and treated like a King and Queen from the moment you step foot in there. We stayed in a premier suite that was very nice and comfortable but I think all rooms would be the same. The Staff are the friendliest people, they must have a strict customer relations camp they go to . The breakfast is sensational with two restaurants to choose from, if you’re not satisfied with their selection you never will be anywhere they catered for all walks of life. The grounds are so well manicured we even saw a person out there racking leaves at 10 pm. There is 3 pools that back onto the beachfront. I think the pools are designed just for relaxing as they are not that deep. Overall if you want a quiet relaxing holiday this is the place.I don’t think it;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;tomac1957;Fantastic Resort;This was our 3rd visit to The Anvaya, this time staying for 7 nights and once again give them 10 out of 10. This time we stayed to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary and enjoyed every moment of it. The hotel staff are second to none, the resort is clean and well maintained. We arrived late at night but were still greeted with a smile,welcome drink and wet towel.I would like to thank the hotel for giving us an upgrade and for the extra special treats every night along with the turn down service.;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Mia;Highly recomand;The hotel was nice, but the service is unbelievable. Everybody was so kind and polite, we had a problem with something in our room and even the manager called to ask if everything is all right and he offered his support in case we'll need anything. They had our room cleaned every day, 7 days they changed the sheets and everything. Breakfast was variate and tasty. 10 out of 10 and if we'll go to Bali again we'll be staying here again for sure.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;UkFordy;Fantastic quiet hotel central for everything;My husband and I booked our second week in Bali here after staying in Nusa Dua. Amazing hotel. We booked a premier lagoon access room 2126. We asked for a quiet room that gets the sun and that is exactly what we got. Beds and pillows are so comfortable. We get to eat breakfast looking at the sea every morning. The choice of food and quality is exceptional. Biggest cups of good quality coffee Iv ever had. Customer service is excellent. Wi-fi is fast and consistent. This hotel is central for everything, shopping, restaurants,bars, Waterbom. Even though you are so close we couldn’t hear any noise in the hotel. We are still here and check out soon. Gutted to leave.;5;0;1;0;0;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;TKSG88;Very good find;Found a good deal through Agoda and booked this place , very very happy with the location, the service , the amenities and the breakfast Small note that the sands restaurant takes too long (30mins) to serve food you order The restaurant up front serves awesome Indonesian food love it;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Little E;If you will stay in Kuta, you Must sleep here!;We were in this stunning hotel 7 nights and found it as a gem in busy Kuta. Warm welcome occurred with a Balinese drink and wet towel in lobby. After that we went to check in lounge while some delicious snacks and drinks waiting for us! Also received a gift in this room from staff. Everything in hotel was in excellent condition as lots of guests said here. For us there was just a drawback, while my wife got sick in a midnight I asked reception about doctor, she said it will cost 750000IDR and as doctors in Bali has lots of patients, they don’t know when doctor will visit my wife!! I think they can hire a doctor for such a huge hotel or even for several hotels in district and it will make comfort stay for all guests.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Brett_TA_Review;Hidden Gem;The Anvaya is a relaxing, well-appointed resort, located next to a quiet beach in Tuban (South Kuta). Our comfortable Premier Room overlooked the ocean, and it also included a non-alcoholic free mini bar. We ate at both restaurants, the Kunyit and Sands, both were lovely, but Sands was our favourite, as it overlooked the beach. There was plenty to do, including free aqua aerobics, table tennis, volleyball and cycling. The resort also has three independent pools, with a large quantity of lounge chairs, making it a place to rest and relax.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;ohmytinyfeet;Had My Wedding At Anvaya;We just had our wedding at Anvaya on the 16 March 2019. We stayed there for 7 days (for preparation for wedding). That place is heaven!!! Good location as it's just 20 mins away from airport WITH Jam! The buffet spread was awesome! The room beds all are so comfy! This hotel should be 6 stars! It's kids friendly too as some of our friends who stayed there, put their children with the nanny (children's playroom) while they relax at the spa. Definitely will go back for our anniversary next time!;5;0;1;0;0;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;carole g;holiday in bali;Very lovely hotel very clean and staff great. Within walking distance of Matahari in Kuta and also Discovery Mall. Beach close by. Had high tea lovely, but sandwiches came out dry. They did not wrap them in the kitchen with gladwrap to keep them fresh. Lovely pool had room overlooking pool. Draw back with that was patrons did not keep to the keep out of pool at certain times. Had to keep calling security to get them out. Breakfast really good and a lot to choose from.;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Shivani M;Lovely hotel;We had a very pleasant stay at the Anvaya. It’s clearly a very luxurious and vast resort, which benefits from world class facilities and the beach side location (sunset view) is a real perk. We booked a premier room which was very spacious and modern! Breakfast was lovely and the pools are amazing! Few small issues with housekeeping and general service (expected for a resort of this size), but doesn’t detract from the experience materially.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;SlmS1992;Amazing, amazing, amazing!!;Do not be put off by the location, this resort is a world of its own. The resort is as aesthetically pleasing as the pictures. Service was top notch, shout out to Ayin Purwati, the manager who did everything she could to accommodate us. After hearing that it was my birthday trip, she upgraded us to the Lagoon Access pool which was amazing as we could take a dip in the semi private pool that is right behind our room. Dewa, the sports instructor is such a fun soul and puts a smile on our faces everytime we conversed. Every staff member we encountered poured their heart and soul into ensuring we had a comfortable stay. The breakfast spread is on another level! I have never seen a bigger spread in my life!

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;RMK_10;Romantic Tranquility - The Anvaya is the Heart of Kuta;Hotel is not very far from Airport (Denapasar) but don't let that put you off from experiencing the glory that is The Anvaya. You need to haggle & get a fair priced Taxi to Hotel which will give you invaluable education of financial transactions in Bali. Unfortunately, being off season, there are many unscrupulous traders looking to profit from tourists, which can of course happen anywhere globally. We arrived in Hotel from what seems mayhem outside of traffic/noise in bustling busy metropole, with shops & restaurants either side of road, with traders lining the pavements offering services. Hotel was calm & really quite until we checked into our room, with traffic horns sounding & music blaring from front near one of the pool.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;RockMumPerth;Fantastic resort;We booked in here for the Nyepi package, 2 nights and Nyepi (Silence) day. Check in was extremely busy and took almost 2 hours, but we were able to wait in the beautiful lobby and there were snacks and drinks available free of charge to us. We finally made it to our room and were very disappointed. We called the management and were upgraded to a pool view room which was amazing. I would always check what room you have actually booked as there is another section that is nowhere as nice and not near the main pool. The buffet breakfast is superb. Loads of choices to eats, drink and seating. A very popular hotel for people from all over the world, we felt like the only Aussies there. Gorgeous grounds and luxurious lounges and even pool toys.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;rachnachopraverma;Blessing to stay in this property;the hotel was in an excellent location in Kuta, Bali, far away from the crowded streets still near to all facilities and main market area.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Krystle L;Company trip;Had our company trip and decided to choose this hotel. It was a great stay! The hotel gave a free upgrade to premier room. The rooms were spacious enough. Toiletries were great(ACCA KAPPA), even the toothbrush was of high quality! Breakfast was great! Spa was very affordable and AMAZINGGG! There was foc minibar for our room. Room service food was great(better than the restaurant itself when we dined for lunch and dinner). Location was great!! The hotel charges 50,000 rupiah for misplacement of room card, which can be quite ridiculous, as I’ve stayed in many hotels before and this is the first hotel with such policy. Would definitely come back to stay again, probably will try out their villas :);4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;FunTrvlCpl;Unbelievable service;They definitely cant be beat when it comes to service. No issues there whatsoever. Breakfast is very good. The service in the breakfast room was impeccable the first day, but not so much the second as we had a hard time finding someone to get coffee are clean the table from prior group. However, the rest was good. We stayed in the deluxe room and found out we couldn't have breakfast by water. That seems silly as neither restaurant was all that busy. Instead, we had to eat street side. We did enjoy the trio who played on Tuesday, just wished that they played longer sets. They play 4 or 5 songs then take 20 min. breaks. Pool is very nice and a nice gym.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Sabine R;Perfekt Stay in this Hotel;Hotel and service was really good, and the private beach is really a private beach (bay) with security watching nobody outside of the Hotel can enter, which also means that the beach and sand is clean compared to the public beaches next to it. But actually we prefered to stay at the big main pool. (in total the Hotel has 6) Only the main pool is aroung 150m long. Than a second. pool for playing pool volleyball, and so on. 2 side Pools with direct entrance from the Hotelrooms next to it. Another pool in the back area of Hotel also very nice, and a pool in the kids club. The service was perfect, the stuff super nice. We stayed on the silent day in the Hotel, they provides full movies on the TV and also wifi only for Hotel Guests. So TOP service. We extented the stay for one;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Harmonie;Lovely resort;We chose Anvaya for our company trip to Bali and have to say it's just simply lovely. We had a full day meeting in one of their meeting rooms and their food for tea breaks were delicious. The resort has about 5 pools (i think) and a private beach - though the beach was a let down as it has rubbish all over the place. Our room was great but the shower has a drainage issue that flooded the bathroom. Breakfast spread from Kunyit restaurant was good with many varieties for you to choose. Food from both Sands and Kunyit were just okay, i find that food from their room service was waaayy better. Location is strategic, walking distance to local pubs, restaurants, local shops, massage parlours, couple of shopping malls, church, convenient stores, etc. Overall it was a good stay and;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;gabe;Beautiful resort but not the best for conferences;The resort is reasonably close to the airport (about a 20 minute cab ride), has great amenities, neatly kept grounds, generally friendly staff, spacious rooms with very comfortable beds and pillows, and direct access to the beach at the back (near the Sands restaurant), as well as a pool. It has thoughtful touches like a departure lounge with snacks where guests who've checked out can wait in comfort for a couple of hours before heading to the airport. However, this was not the best place to have a conference with a lot of people from different countries. The conference room projectors were blurry, and there were several mix-ups about airport transfers. At first there was a problem about several participants' arrivals not being listed, then the same problem came up at;4;0;1;1;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Sequin;Paradise;Absolutely loved it here!! The hotel grounds are amazing, the staff are friendly, the rooms were clean. Such good value for money. The beach out front the hotel was clean and quiet. Only thing I disliked was the fact that there are two separate breakfast areas, the breakfast area on the street is for the deluxe rooms, and all other rooms have a view of the beach and better service. Wish that had been explained to us when we booked.;5;1;0;1;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;capetownian86;Five star ⭐️ resort capabilities. Friendly staff. Central and new. Terrible beach.;I stayed here for 7 days. It was WONDERFUL. From the beginning, staff members are friendly and interactive, throughout the day there was always someone with a friendly face. The staff are mostly friendly young people. The Rooms: As mentioned this is a new resort so everything is fantastic and very intricately designed. The room was well thought of and included all new amenities. I chose the premier suite which was 85sqm which is quite large for a solo traveler but I wanted the freedom. Room services are excellent (the boys at room services go above and beyond, so sweet). Food: There are 2 restaurants The Sand and Kuyiyek (I think it’s called), I had the choice of breakfast in both because I stayed at the premier room. I preferred eating from The Sands;5;0;0;1;1;0;0

We were very impressed with her she is an exceptional manager Most mornings and some evenings we ate at the Sands restaurant by the ocean with amazing views but even better food. The food and beverage manger Harim is an exceptional manager who welcomed us each day who took time out to make sure all our needs were met and the manager Sandi looked after us as if;5;0;0;1;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;jacquir99;Amazing place to stay. Staff out of this world!;We stayed at the Anvaya for 9 nights in a Premier Lagoon access room – an upgrade from the Premier room we had booked. The Assistant Front Office Manager, Ms Eka Suastuti – was outstanding. The service she gave us before we arrived was out of this world. Answers via email were very prompt and she went out of her way to ensure we would be looked after during our stay. She arranged our upgrade to ensure my mother (77 yo) had a short walk to the restaurant and direct access to our own pool area. The hotel provided free airport transfers and when we walked out from customs, there was my name on a sign, held by a lovely young man from the resort with the biggest smile. He couldn’t have been more helpful. Only about a 15-minute drive to the hotel.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;janpiro;Had a wonderful holiday;We stayed at the Anvaya for 8 nights in two Premier Lagoon View rooms on the 5th floor. Our first impressions was excellent. Fast and friendly check-in. We waited for a short while in the lounge with snacks included. Our room was a little smaller than I'd expected but very clean and had everything we needed. I would have appreciated a little more storage space but it wasn't a deal breaker. Once we were organized it worked fine for us. Once we saw the Lagoon Access rooms we would have liked to upgrade but we needed two rooms and none were available. Next time, we will definitely book Lagoon Access. The staff at the Anvaya have been mentioned many times in the reviews on TA and I can only add to the accolades. They are all wonderful, helpful and friendly.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Nasim J;Amazing stay at Anvaya Beach resort;We spent couple of amazing nights at this trendy resort. Location is fantastic, close to airport and within walking distance from Discovery shopping mall, restaurants, Cafes and pharmacy. The best breakfast you can ever experience in the area. The chef got trained in germany and she makes deserts and pastry look like as pieces of arts . Hotel features direct beach access, pool suites. Rooms are modern with comfortable bed. Bathroom amenities a great local brand. Staff are professional with smiley faces. In general excellent place to get the feeling of city and resort stay both in one shot.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Before restauration it was Santika beach Kuta hotel. It a really nice hotel with different types of rooms. We stayed in a room with a private pool access. The bathroom is nice and big. The rooms are very nice and clean, maybe a bit to small but they are very nice. The breakfast is GREAT INCREDIBLE WOOOOOW. The staff is nice and very kind, ther is also free wi-fi in the hotel.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Lana H;Amazing we didn't want to leave;When my boyfriend and I stepped out of the car and saw hotel Anvaya, the words that came out both our mouths were: ''OMG WOWWW!!'' This hotel is absolutely stunning, I don't even know where to begin. The lobby area is gorgeous and so much effort and detail has been put into the grounds and the surroundings. I would like to thank the hotel staff for being so friendly and accommodating, and thank you to 'The Rock' who did the pool aerobics. That was soo much fun I really enjoyed myself and everyone had a great laugh :) Also thank you for organizing a free birthday surprise for my boyfriends birthday. It was really, really appreciated thank you:) The breakfast: Woah. Just awesome. Everything you could ever feel like for breakfast is here.;5;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;intan_linggo;Our pleasant stay;Our first time stay at The Anvaya was wonderful. Check in was pleasant with ibu Elis. She’s very friendly and helpful. Our bellboy was really nice too, I forgot his name, he explained all the things that we have in the room and where are the restaurants. We stayed for 6 nights in the Premiere room. The room itself was nice and clean. They provide everything, include free minibar drinks and they even got a powerful hairdryer (not the lousy one that took forever to dry your hair). The bed was huge and very comfortable. One thing that was disturbing us was the noise. You could hear every noise in the corridor and outside at the pool area. Especially when there were lots of people (we stayed on Chinese new year period). We also had some problems with the room but it was resolved;5;0;0;1;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;bradbP1325HC;Our Relaxing Anniversary Retreat;We have just spent a much needed restful holiday in Bali and to our delight booked the best resort to date (my 7th visit) From the outset we were treated as special guests and when eating breakfast in Kunyit (one of their restaurants) we felt like treasured members of the family. We love Bali because of the beautiful friendly people and were delighted to find so many exceptional people in this lovely resort. A special thank you to Ayin for seeking us out amongst so many guests and ensuring we will return because of the fabulous customer service. If you visit you really need to experience the welcoming team in Kunyit not only for breakfast but do lunch or dinner - it is a truly unique Balinese traditional meal and experience!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Akashchopra24;Excellent resort;Our stay in Anvaya was for almost 5 nights. Below are the points that make Anvaya standout of the crowd : 1. Excellent location : They have a private beach you can go for a morning walk , take anevening stroll along the beach road which connects it to a nearby mall and finally relax at beach in the night. 2. Wonderful breakfast: Though it had little options for Indian breakfast but each day we tried breakfast from different regions . I was awstruck to see the options it had for breakfast , from danish to english , chinese to Indian , you will will get everything there. 3. Rooms and staff: Rooms were very clean , nice and airy. We didn’t had any issues during our stay. Staff was very friendly and coperative. Enjoy ur stay in Bali.;5;0;1;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;thompsonjackie;World class;We visited the Anvaya end of jan prior to joining a cruise in Singapore. The hotel is very special ,but what makes it so special is the staff. They can’t do enough for you and are so friendly and helpful sorting out anything and everything quickly. The breakfast is the best I’ve seen. There is a beautiful aroma that fills the hotel and I wish I knew what it was as I’d love to buy some! Would highly recommend to anyone. .;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Paul M;Better than Bagus!;Having stayed in the Anvaya's gorgeous previous incarnation, the Santika Beach Resort, we were curious to see how the new resort compared. It soon became clear that the loss of the 'old Bali charm' embodied in it's predecessor was more than compensated by the superb service and facilities that characterise the Anvaya. Breakfast was outstanding. All service, from dealings at reception through to maintenance and cleaning staff as well the Recreation team were so helpful and good natured as well as extremely proficient in their various roles. The availability of a waiting room as we waited for the late night flight on the day of departure where you could even take a shower and have light refreshments was most welcome. We will definitely be returning to this beautiful resort.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Etempl;Very peaceful;Very nice place for a few days. Very clean, extremely helpful and friendly staff. Breakfast buffet had incredible variety.nice big clean pools.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Meliani Soetikno;Such a wonderful resort hotel!;I really enjoyed my stay at Anvaya. Special mention to their services. First when I arrived they kept my luggage, welcomed by woman and delivered me to receptionist table. I arrived at 1 pm and check in time at 2 pm. After registered they take me to waiting lounge I can enjoy foods and drinks. Around 45 minutes they call me told that my room was ready. I'm so impressed they gave me upgrade to premiere room that have lagoon access, set up for anniversary birthday and honeymoon at room. The room was great, clean and beautiful. The bed so big and pillow so comfort. The view was awesome. I will stay here again when I visit to Bali next time. Thank you anvaya! Thumbs up for your staff!;5;0;0;0;0;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Reena Asrani;Enjoyed the stay;This was our first visit to Bali but we had good experience at ANVAYA Resort, Kuta. The resort is just 15 min drive away from Airport. Its at the center area of Kuta surrounded by shopping malls, shops for window shoppers, bars and good restaurant specially Indian restaurants also. And the very beautiful sunset at ANVAYA'S private beach is unforgettable. The walking track ,side by side the beach, attract joggers in the morning and the couples for a pleasant walk at eve, staying in resort. We were very much satisfied by breakfast buffet service also. So over all we were back at home with good memories of Bali trip.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;MountainToCoast;Beyond Wonderful!!;We recently had the absolute privilege of staying at the ANVAYA for 7 nights. We booked 2 x Premier Lagoon Access Rooms and we loved stepping onto our balcony and straight into the lagoon pool, which was a perfect temperature I might add. The Lagoon Access rooms were well worth the extra $$. While the rooms, facilities and the location of this hotel are fantastic .... it’s actually the staff who lift the ANVAYA to a whole new level. They bring the ‘soul’ to this 5* Resort. I will give a special mention to Tirtha & Sandi in the Sands Restaurant who I looked forward to chatting to each day and also to Dewa ‘The Rock’ from the Pool Area who was just an all round great guy!!! But I also want to draw attention to some of the lesser mentioned staff members - to the groundskeepers;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Susan T;An Oasis in Kuta;This 5 star resort is an oasis in Kuta...it's beautiful and quiet. The best of both worlds as once you step outside the resort you are in Kuta town where it's bustling and full of shops, massage parlors and restaurants.This is probably one of the best beach resorts we've stayed at in all our travels around the world. The staff are so friendly and customer focused. Always a smile and they bend over backwards to help you. A shout out to Didi Marsinta, the PR Manager, at the resort. - The resort provides a complimentary breakfast at their Sands restaurant which is out of this world.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Elnaz J;Highly recommended;We really enjoyed our stay at this resort. The location is just perfect since it's not far from the airport and a close to the shopping/bar area and there are so many restaurants nearby. We booked deluxe room but since it was our anniversary they updated our room to primer and set very nice art towel with flowers. We had option to eat between kunyit and sand for breakfast. Sand was brilliant they had local food, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, fresh pastries, fresh fruit and smoothies. The room was super clean and every day in the afternoon they deliver cookies or pastries in our room. We had 2 times lunch by the pool, the first day the price was reasonable and food was delicious. However, the day after chef was changed the quality of food decreased;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;teliazaar;The best new hotel in Kuta;The hotel has just undergone major renovation. And, it look more modern. I love the wide lobby ambiance which embrace the fengshui fountain water pond. The location is pretty easy to find in the midst of busy Kuta destination. But, in the hotel you can still feel peaceful and comfortable. The room is very clean and tidy. And, I don't have problem to balance the cold and hot water, not as I usually has experienced in other hotels. The same goes to in room AC temperature regulator. In short, this was an extremely wonderful staying. And, I will definitely come back.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Nothing overly fancy and the rooms were faultless The service and genuine care taken by staff is unparalleled. We also ate at Sands Restaurant and our meal was one that I will not soon forget. The food was amazing and have a good Indian station where the chefs are ready to offer all you want. Spa treatment at Santika is worth a try . Very relaxing and excellent standard.

The manager Satrya even stopped by to have a chat to ensure we were well cared for. We were so chuffed by this little but welcoming gesture that we will be back with friends. I wish more hotels in Bali were like this, the special attention to detail makes it even more memorable. They make you feel like family!

Even the restaurants are different Kunvit (with indonesian food) for Deluxe room and Sands for premier rooms. My room was not ready and had to wait till 4pm. They have a lounge, so I was asked to have tea and snacks at the lounge. WiFi is an issue and gets disconnected every now and then. I also attended the gala dinner, only one drink was served, the entertainment program was very ordinary. Food for the vegetarian was a challenge.How ever chef prepared nice noodles for us;4;0;1;0;1;1;0

The room had a nice big bed and a little balcony overseeing the lagoon below. After settling in we went for a walk to the beach and it was one of the cleanest beaches we saw during our stay in Bali. There is a path along the beach that leads to a shopping mall and some restaurants at the neighboring hotels (great way if you want to avoid the busy road and sellers) The Sands restaurant (part of the hotel along the beach) is a nice place to relax, enjoy the view and enjoy cocktails with proper alcohol (I say this because most places we went to had diluted alcohol or non at all in the cocktails) While we were here we ordered some;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Caroline L;Beautiful Hotel;What can i say but The Anvaya that hasnt been said. We stayed for a week at this gorgeous hotel. The staff are all amazing. Anvaya obviously spend alot of time training their staff. These people are true professionals and do their jobs with a smile. Please treat them with the respect they deserve. Unfortunately we did see a couple couple of guests who were very rude to them. Breakfast. If you cant find something that is your problem. Biggest buffet spread i have ever seen. Indian. Chinese. Western. Pizza. Sushi. Great coffee. Iced coffee. Latte. Flat white. You name it and its included. Easy to get the all important deck chair even when hotel was full which i believe it was between christmas and new year. We had a premier room which was lovely. Clean. Modern. Decent size.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;KarnadyJuan;Good enough;The bed is very comfortable and there are a lot of restaurants nearby. Kuta beach is also 10 min walk away from this hotel. Some minor stuff that bothers me : there's only one door for the bathroom and even when the door closed , the water leaks out from the shower room . The pools are miniscule and it's less than perfect for actual swimming. You need to pay extra to have breakfast in sands restaurant (which is ridiculous);4;0;1;0;0;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;waseems9584;Fantastic Hotel;Fantasic hotel, offers great value for money with a 5 star experience. Rooms are modern and fresh.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;SKFord;Impressive;Great rooms, friendly staff, good Resteraunt’s / food, nice bars and surrounds. This is my 7th visit to Bali and as it was over the xmas period accommodation was limited. We stumbled across this property via booking.com and it seemed to ‘tick’ all of our requirements. We were impressed with the close location to Kuta Square and the abundance of transport options available right outside the hotel. We spend a couple of days within the grounds and it is a really nice, simple and clean environment. The staff from checkin, security and waiters couldn’t have been more obliging to us and exceeded our expectations. Would highly recommend this hotel for all types of travelers to Kuta. Thanks for having us😀;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

You gave us a holiday we will never forget and memories to last a life time. Thank you is not enough to express how much we appreciate every last detail and the lengths you went to for us. We spent two blissful weeks at Anvaya and from the moment we arrived, you welcomed us and made us feel so at home. The staff are so attentive and care about every last detail, wanting you to feel comfortable and happy. We never waited more than a moment for someone to attend to us, whether at the pool, the SANDS restaurant or the room service, we were absolutely blown away by the speedy and extremely coherent team! We have very specific dietary requirements which involve extreme attention to detail and creative;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Location great, near the airport and at the beach. Amazing rooms! Clean and spotless. No comments at all, except that the WiFi disconnects all the time, you have to re-enter over and over again. But who needs WiFi on holiday? And the shower door should open to the inside, not to the outside :) The breakfast: OMG! Amazing! Over the top :) If I ever go back to Kuta, I will stay in this hotel again! Bravo!;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

If you can consider upgrading to a premiere room as it is so worth it, the breakfast in the Sands restaurant was to die for everything you could ever want for breakfast is there, all staff were wonderful and polite. We had a Lagoon Access Room and it was perfect, staff once again were wonderful and polite, a special thanks to Didi who made it very easy to email and communicate. We stayed at the Resort from the 10/12/18 until 14/12/18 it was the best resort ever, I have been to Bali 6 times and this holiday was wonderful.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Dimple;Value for money;I was at this resort for 3 nights, had really nice time with my friends and husband.. in our whole stay i was just disappointed by checkin process, my husband went at 1.30 pm for checkin, they said rooms are not ready so then we all went at 3pm still rooms were not ready and made us waited for 30/40 mins, just a suggestion it will be great if ladies at reception & restaurant can wear smile on their face. Inspite of waiting so long they have not even offered us a welcome drink and was offered to other checkin people. Being vegetarian there was hardly any options for breakfast even that is also tasteless.. But i will still recommend this hotel because of their beautiful big rooms, well equipped bathroom, swimming pools, cleaniness, connected to beach, and want to say speacial;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Reza Ghozali;3 Nights;Stayed for 3 nights for conference. Had that a spacious bed room but without the best view, facing other hotel on the right side. Had a nice breakfast in Kunyit Restaurant with various choises of food. Spend nice dinner in Sands Restaurant whilst enjoying sunset time with ala carte menu. Noticed that this hotel has 3 pools with 2 of them can be accessed directly from rooms. Not mentioning the villa type rooms, retricted area, no idea what facilities they had. Definately will be my first choise again for business trip.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Wasabi416;Amazing;Wow! So luxurious! For only 280 usd a night, we had a suite that’s more like a private pool villa all to ourselves. Inside you’ll have a huge bed and sofa with a sliding door that gives you instant access to your private plunge pool. As you go towards the back of the room you’ll enter an equally huge bath area complete with A couples’ rain shower, a private toilet area with bidet, a tub facing a TV and a gorgeous sunroof. It’s a bit of a walk towards the suite. You’ll even pass by a beach area where street vendors sell their trade and goods before you reach it.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;The Good Doctor;Best of Bali ❤️;Although Kuta in general has become somewhat run down, this resort still shines out. My friend and I stayed here for 5 nights and it was absolutely fantastic. We booked a standard double room and got upgraded to a premier room for free on arrival. The room was spacious and came with a free minibar. The hotel is well maintained and impeccably clean. Staff are friendly and very helpful. The breakfast buffet was absolutely outstanding with over 100 dishes to choose from, including a separate halal station. The best part is still however the pool and beach area. There are three pools in the entertainment area, along with a bar and various sporting activities. This leads directly onto to the beach. To be honest the beaches in Bali are not the greatest (we have better;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;mcfan;Hidden gem in kuta;Went for a 4D3N stay at this hotel. It was an amazing time there. We paid for an upgrade to the hotel room with lagoon access. It was well worth the price. The hotel room was very comfortable and clean. I love the 50m pool. The breakfast spread was amazing. Overall it was a lovely hotel. The only negative review about this place is that it can be a bit noisy at times due to poor noise insulation inside the hotel room. You could hear people walking in the corridor if they are talking loudly or noise from the reception hall. Overall, I would still go back again.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Abriella;Best resort I've ever been in Bali;Anvaya is definitely become my favorite hotel in Bali. It is located in Kuta area, but in crowded Kuta area. Anvaya invested a lot in pools. They have 4 swimming pools and many decorative pools. When you enter the lobby, you will see their huge decorative pool along your pathway which is stunning and relaxing. I stay here for 3 days and I wish I could stay longer because their bed and pillows are very comfy, fluffy, and cloudy! Foods, I couldn't ask for more. They are all delicious. Bathroom is huge and clean completed with amenities from shower cream to comb. The best part from Anvaya is their private beach. It is clean, quiet, wave is also good, and you can also enjoy very beautiful sunset from here. I rate this resort 10/10.;5;0;1;0;1;1;1

The rooms have the biggest beds that are so comfortable, our room was cleaned at least twice a day with the water etc being replenished, we also got little treats left everyday from macaroons to truffles and the added extra of a bed friend made out of towlels with a note to say thank you. The breakfast options are vast and offer everything from pizza to waffles.

The location is good in the heart of Kuta and near the Restaurants and night life. If there is an advice to take “ don’t miss the breakfast at the Anvaya” it is a very rich buffet with amazing look over the waterfront. I really liked it and if I decided to cane again to Bali I’ll choose it again and again.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;AlastairM;Great Experience;Our recent 12 night stay was excellent. Staff are always available and willing to assist and very friendly.

No swim up pool bar. Pools are 1.2M deep with several two person bean bags to float around on. There are limited scheduled activities free daily such as instructed poolside canvas painting one afternoon, guided bike rides two mornings, some pool aerobics mid morning, poolside bali music lessons too.

My partner has limited mobility and we were offered a wheelchair for the duration of our stay...this made life very easy and was very much appreciated. Much has been said in aother reviews about the breakfast. All of these reviews are accurate...the breakfast is amazing with a huge variety of cuisines to choose from...it would be very hard to get bored with choice even for a longer stay.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;AngelC83;Amazing Resort with best breakfast buffet;Stayed here for 3 nights in the Premium room. The super king size bed was so comfortable. The free mini bar (restocked each day when room is cleaned) was a bonus. The buffet breakfast at Sands Restaurant is the best I’ve ever seen, such a huge variety from all different cuisines. Our room wasn’t ready yet when we were checking in so they guided us to a refreshment room where we can have some food and drinks while waiting. We didn’t have to wait for long. Checkout was easy. All the staff here are super friendly and loved to play with our toddler son. There’s a kids club which our son loved, the 2 ladies that manage that club were great. Location wise, can’t get any better, it’s in between the two biggest shopping malls in Kuta (Lippo and Discovery mall). Will definitely come back;5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Richard C;Great location;Excellent resort with one exception. It was advertised as a no smoking resort. This was only if you were inside. There are smokers by the pool, on the balconies, in all outdoor eating areas and we often had to move or rush our food. It is a big resort and these common areas could be divided into smoke free zones. Breakfast was exceptional.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

They are very attentive and really enjoy their job which is great to see. The breakfast was amazing with so many options available for all, the staff here were fantastic and called you by name and made you feel at home.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Christopher Jes... G;Elegant, modern luxury in the center of Kuta!;This was the most contemporary hotel we stayed in and its design was breathtaking. What an elegant and beautiful hotel! Its location was perfect. It allowed us to easily find taxis for trips outside of Kuta, and also allowed to take a stroll down the streets of Kuta to explore its wonderful selection of restaurants, as well as its many markets for souvenir shopping. It was the last hotel we lodged in before our departure back home and its location is a convenient short drive from the airport. The hotel has many pools - we had the option of enjoying a pool right next to our room, or a bigger pool close to the bar and the beach. The hotel also has a “departure lounge” where you have access to computers, showers, and coffee/tea before your departure. This lounge was perfect for us;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

They succeeded wonderfully to keep the old atmosphere although its al brand new. The rooms are beautiful and breakfast is beyond imagination with something special for all tastes. The only point of critique is the reception and Check in. We had two stays and both times they told us our booked rooms (Laguna access rooms, booked and paid for a month in advance!) were not available and we had to fight to get them after all.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Johnmango928;Top Notch Hotel;The Anvaya has to be one of the best hotels I have ever experiencedd in many years of travel. Everything from the check-in, to the nice spacious room, to the beautiful hotel grounds, the beach access etc. are top notch. The best asset is the staff: always friendly and greeting the guests. The breakfast buffet has actually too many choices which personally I don't think is necessary: from bakery items to Indonesuan food to omelette station to dim sum to some sushi. Just way too many varieties. Another great amenity is the Departure Lounge for guests who have checked out but may have late flights. The lounge has bathrooms and shower facilities. Not many hotels have that.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Hosni H;Pleasant experience;First to start with location: only 10 minutes from the airport and cost within 50K to get there, I was afraid that it will be a bit noisy but you don't even feel that airport is near by. Breakfast: just perfection they do have everything from local, international cuisines and indian food. Room: a bit disappointed that i didn't get the pool access room as hotel was fully booked but rooms is pretty spacious, clean and well designed, the only thing missing is bathtub, i'm not sure about if there is a problem in A/C because it was like impossible to set temperature at 27º but in general acceptable.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Travellife;Five star getaway;We went to this resort for a bit of a break away. The hotel rooms are stunning and huge. We had a room with our own plunge pool. It was luxurious and such a treat. The hotel itself is new and beautiful. The beach is clear and quiet, great for relaxing and just taking time out to read a book. I truly enjoyed my stay at the resort. It is on the main road in Kuta, so close to shopping malls and restaurants as well as night markets and bars. The vibe in the area is great for youngsters but still peaceful enough for someone wanting to relax. Thank you for a beautiful stay. It was so special.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Yohanes S;Luxury Escape at Kuta;Stay at beginning of October, and yes I expect much from this 5 star hotel. Cause I've visited them before they change name to Anvaya. This hotel come to fulfill all the expectation.. Yes I have a longer check in period, they give me not just welcome drink but they gave entire snack corner to wait to.. it was almost like an afternoon tea or coffee buffet there. The room actually feel a little narrower from the last time I came, but Its well decorated, and really it make you can easilly fall asleep and don't want to get out from Bed. Breakfast also fantastic, the choice was amazingly great in number and it taste very good. Try to enjoy the beach in the afternoon, you will be presented with a beautiful sunset to enjoy with an uncrowded beach. Unluckily I dont have the chance to;4;0;0;1;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;DavidW1212;A great resort close to Kuta and the airport.;We have stayed in Bali on many occasions and I stayed in many locations within Bali. This was our first night at the hotel and we were quite impressed. You are in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Kuta but once you walk into your resort, it’s pretty quiet and very welcoming. Anvaya offers many free activities to which we took up the morning bike tour which was fantastic. The beach is not the best in Bali but adequate for a dip. There are plenty of pools for swimming if you don’t like the salt water. There are 2 breakfast sites with the one nearer to the beach being a little more expensive than the other but is amazing (we looked but were not offered to pay the extra which I would have done happily and I would advise you do). The cheaper breakfast is less western but was;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;osiris martinez;OUTSTANDING ❤️ Hidden peaceful gem;You know a place is unusually good when you don’t even find the words to describe it. Well, this resort is one of those places. The staff and the service is probably one of the bests you can have in a 5 resort in Bali. Smiles and kind words all day long from every single person of the huge team, the most amazing Buffet Breakfast you can imagine (variety and high quality of the offer), an amazing swimming pool in front of the sea with a bar to enjoy coconuts, drinks and snacks all day long from a longchair, a sea view restaurant with an open kitchen where MAGIC happens with every single meal they prepare, and a delicious gem: Kunyit restaurant, where the guest can enjoy a night traditional show discovering the most amazing Indonesian meals in its highest and best version.

We loved how clean it was and well maintained the grounds were. I am obsessed with the decor and rain chains they have down their long walk path. I have been searching the web everywhere for them to purchase! This hotel will make an excellent stay for anyone. I hope to one day return!;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;ista660;Good vibe;Very nice hotel new and bright. The sands restaurant is buzzing lovely to sit on the sand overlooking the beach and sunset and Getting a foot massage. breakfast is huge though very busy the only issue I had was we had booked two rooms one was for three people and really they cannot squeeze in the third bed so It was not the most comfortable of stays but they try to make up by giving us a fairly late check-out but we Decided to Pay so that wecould stay there till seven. Nice location next door to the town but you don’t really realise it as the property is secluded. Spa is ok Good massage but not enough good massage but Does not seem to have a sauna;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Clark K;Fantastic place to stay;Stayed in a premier pool access room for 21 nights in September. couldn't ask for better. the staff were fantastic.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;jetski38;Fabulous five star resort;Excellent 5 star resort couldn't fault this place. The resort is spotless. We stayed in a premier room which was very spacious with a huge bed. The complimentary soft drinks and water in the mini bar were great. The Anvaya has a very calming atmosphere with touches of Bali mingled with the luxury you would expect from a five star resort. There are numerous lounges and sitting areas around the pools and on the beach which is accessible from the back of the resort, always plenty to choose from in the sun and also in the shade. The aqua aerobics is fun in the main pool at 11am a great way to work some of the fabulous breakfast. The Sands dining room is fabulous, again spotless.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Jennifer Z;Enjoyable stay;Really enjoyed our stay at The Anvaya Beach Resort. Excellent location. Room simple, but very clean. Great restaurants on site. Amazing beach area with beach chairs - a great place to watch the sunset and have a drink. Only area for improvement would be the phone service. It often took a while to get an answer via phone, and in trying to arrange for our laundry to be done I was transferred several times before reaching the right person. Otherwise, a great hotel and would recommend.;4;0;0;0;0;1;0

Offered snacks and drinks whilst we waited a further 1 hr 30 minuets for our room to be ready, time by now was 15.40, whilst the hotel is lovely, they need to look at how they organise house keeping as many were waiting for their rooms at the same time as us. Other than that hotel is great.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Bear G;Fantastic holiday;Had a great short vacay with the family. Truly 5 star treatment, experience and amenities. All staff friendly and helpful. My kid loved the kids play area and the staff there took good care of her. I went to other hotels nearby for lunch/dinner. Nothing compared to the class of avanya. Only feedback I’d give is to have more variety local dishes in the menu. The hotel across had a live band and cheaper and better menu. Might want to consider if it feasible. Again it’s just a suggestion. But I’ll only visit this hotel for my trip to Bali;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Ardhi_Syaifuddin;Checked all the boxes for a luxurious Balinese hotel;This two-year running hotel (opened in 2016) checked all the boxes for an ideal luxurious hotel in Kuta Beach, or even Bali. Great location? Check! It's located just less than 2 km from the airport and also close to Kuta/ Legian area. Price worthy? Check! I was worried for it costs less than some other similar type hotels, but I was dead wrong. Warm hospitality from the staff? Check! Although they could be more motivated to greet the guests everytime they walked past us in the hallway. Easy check-in & check-out? Check! The lovely Linda at the reception even allowed me to check-in almost one hour earlier so I could hit the pool in no time. Talking about the swimming pool, there's not one, not two, but THREE swimming pools! With the center one could be transformed into a water;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;ajit_induchudan;Large glamorous property at Kuta;We stayed couple of nights here around mid September. This is one of the largest hotels in the city (or so I presume) with around 500 rooms. The property is well spread out and has a wide range of room options to suit different range of luxury travellers. What I really liked: - every inch of the room showcased an effort to do one step better than standard hotel rooms. Be it the toiletries, mini bar, ordering dishes for room service using the tv, large king sized mattresses, visual appeal of the room and washrooms, etc. I was very impressed on first sight! - extremely courteous staff, though its common in Bali, these guys were extra patient, easy to communicate with and very approachable. - lavish breakfast spread.;4;0;0;1;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Claudia A;The breakfast was amazing.;Came here on holiday with my friends. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the beach is not very good to swim in. There are too many rocks. They have 2 different pools and we also stayed in a room that had it's own pool as well. The breakfast has everything and anything. Noodle and omelet station. American, Balinese, Chinese and Indian items as well. Out of all the places I have ever stayed, I have to say this has the most options. On our last night Razak and especially Putu made it very memorable. Thank you Putu, your the best.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Grant_McIntosh;Magical - simply stunning;We had a fantastic 2 weeks here. We booked the Pool access room and were not disappointed. We had sun all day (when the sun was out) and it was very relaxing. We requested a room in the sun all day and luckily one was free. For these we'd recommend rooms 2128 - 2136 as the best. The soft drinks and water in the mini bar are re-stocked fro free each day which is a nice touch. Housekeeping were brilliant and very efficient and thorough. We had a baby and the kids club was also super for that - Eka was great there. Breakfast was a highlight each day. So much variety and choice and overlooking the sea if you go to the Sands Restaurant. Tiptha, Made and Gede made our breakfasts a great experience each day and thanks to them.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Alper Y;Impeccable!;We chose Anvaya for 1 week vacation and it was impeccable. The hotel is quite new, very well maintained, service is world class, staff is always amazing, pool area and other facilities are absolutely fantastic, spa is a must to see, and it is near Kuta center. The only thing that disappointed us was sea, but this is not hotel's fault :) it was our first time in an ocean coastline and we didn't enjoy the wavy sea. I highly recommend here if you are looking for a real five star experience.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

The staff are extremely friendly and courteous, always smiling and greet you by your name. They go out of their way and can't do enough for you. No matter what you ask for, nothing is ever a problem. We booked direct and stayed in the Premier Lagoon access room which was simply stunning (do yourself a favour and book this room type, you definitely won't be disappointed).

We spent a lot of time around the pool which we were greeted by all the pool side staff but one lad stood out called “ RIO RABBIT” ( LUCKY ) who cared for us like we was royalty & treated us with so much respect and he was the star of the show and made our time here great!

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Mimpi_Indah_10;A perfect stay;As frequent travellers to SE Asia, and Bali in particular, we decided to book the Anvaya Beach Resort in Bali from 24th July until 10th August. We, as a family of three, used to visit the Santika Premiere Hotel, which was the previous hotel at the same location in Tuban/Kuta, on numerous occasions before in the past 25 years. After check-in, unfortunately some minor issues occurred while being assigned to our room. However, the situation was promptly taken care of by Mr. Patriawan and his team and an adequate solution was offered, which was to our full satisfaction. This professional approach, after somehow starting on the wrong foot, proofed to us that the Anvaya Beach Resort is really committed to providing the best possible service to their guests.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

The hotel is great, facing the ocean, and food is very good. Staff (like in many places in Bali) is always smiling and helpful and bedrooms are large enough for a short stay. The swimming pool is large enough so that you don't feel packed. Breakfast by the ocean is also of high standard..... definitely a place to recommend for a short stay;4;0;1;1;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Michelle D;Perfect;We had a lovely relaxing 3 nights at The Anvaya Beach Resort. Firstly, the breakfast here is the best I've ever experienced. We stayed in a Premier room and had access to the Sands restaurant for a massive breakfast spread. Anything you want it here, the first day I wandered around with an empty plate overwhelmed by the choice and variety of food. WOW! After eating we burned off a couple of teaspoons of food by taking a nice stroll along the beachfront. Perfect. The rooms are a good size, comfortable bed and big bathroom, the shower was amazing. I also liked the small couch of the balcony, very relaxing with a nice view of the ocean. I really enjoyed the layout of the pools and the fact that there were plenty of sunbeds to choose from. Happy hour was a hit with the cocktails;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;anni_rajani;Beautiful property on the beach;Beautiful property which is very near to the airport, not even 10 minutes drive.Reason we chose this property was that we wanted to explore different areas during first leg of our stay and explore bali. We were upgraded to premiere room so were able to enjoy morning breakfast at their beach restaurant sands. If you choose Deluxe room they have separate breakfast spread at Kunyit or have to pay additional charges I guess 50 k per person if you want to eat at Sands. Which to me seemed weird policy. *Rooms are modern,clean and good value for money. *They give you ample water bottles and don't charge you additional . *Hotel has cycle renting facilty at 50k per hour - which is bit too steep as you can rent motorbikes just from outside the hotel at 65k for entire day and go;4;1;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Le Phuong;Overall a good place to stay in Bali;"A very good, but not great, hotel. We stayed here as a group for a conference. It has most things you want in a resort hotel, but some little things that can make it a ""great"" hotel are missing (having snacks with drinks at the bar, etc.). The staff was wonderful everywhere and made us feel very comfortable, particularly at breakfast and at the meeting rooms. Probably a good place for family vacation as I saw many families with kids there.";4;0;0;1;0;0;0

Special mention to Sandi from the restaurant who was outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble for him and he went the extra mile again and again to make us feel special either around the restaurant or bar. Thank you Sandi - you’re a star!!!! Kudos also to Andi (duty manager) for hosting us so well. Dominic & Annette.;5;1;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Vaidyanaathan;Luxury at a budget pricing;This time, got the chance to stay in this hotel.. Located right in the centre of Jl. Kartika Plaza, Kuta, this Hotel is very near by from the Airport.. Surrounded by good Indian restaurants made us feel very convenient. Excellent reception, friendly staffs, clean and neat rooms, well-maintained Pool, garden, beach-side, huge spread breakfast are few of the salient features of this hotel.. I would strongly recommend this hotel in Kuta, for the indian tourists..! Special mention for Ms. Desi, front desk executive Who assisted us in the best possible ways...! Thanks a lot..!;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;PerthWA05;Comfy beds;We stayed in this location when it was the Santika Plaza Hotel so we thought we`d give the new resort a try. The breakfast has the biggest variety I`v ever seen at a hotel and very tasty. We only ate at the Sands restaurant and the staff were so friendly. Every morning Satrya, Pusba or Made made sure we had our coffee`s how we liked them and served straight away, great service. We had a garden view room, which was ok, but the rooms with pool access look great. There`s plenty of area around the pools with lounges, so you can find a quiet spot to read if you want. Location is good, a lot of places to eat within walking distance.;4;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Carol A;Excellent Hotel Near Airport;This resort is fantastic! It is especially great if you need to be close to the airport but want a luxurious feeling. It is located on the beach and everything about this hotel is wonderful. The service from the moment you arrive till you depart is impeccable. All of their employees are the best! The rooms are very luxurious with the most comfortable beds and linens. A wonderful rainwater shower head and great balcony. There is a great DJ playing the best music as you relax on the beach and in restaurant for your sunset. It has the very best breakfast that is a very generous buffet with an array of fresh juices and a plethora of items to choose from. A couple of our servers who were extra wonderful were Satrya and Crizzoa. But honestly everyone is really great! Location is;5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;CarolinaHisman;Good location;We used to stay in this hotel last time ( last time is santika premiere). Now they renovate and we love this hotel so much. The location is good, the food also good. They have private beach in the back of the hotel, so we can relax or just swim in the swimming pool or ocean. Its a good place to stay and relax while you are in bali;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Inspiration667316;Fantastic !;Lovely stay at this hotel, great range of breakfast from omelettes, to rice if you wish! Several pools, and lovely concierge at the front desk :) ! It has its own private beach with a restaurant and bar, and they even have the hotel name engraved on the coconut. It’s a very new hotel only built in 2016, and it shows as it is very clean and elegant ! It is on the main road so close to all local shops, restaurants, 10 minute drive to Ngurah Rai Airport and 10 min walk to the Waterbom Bali Park! Amazing , and would stay here again :);5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;RicMar41;Beautiful Modern Resort;The Anvaya is a modern, clean and extremely well maintained resort. Room are spotless with all the luxury you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Well located in the Kuta area with just a short walk either along the beach pathway or main road to reach reach restaurants, nightlife etc. Wide range of options at breakfast to suit all tastes. Choice of pools to swim in. However, the most impressive thing about this property is it's staff. It would be hard to find a hotel with such well trained, polite and attentive people to make your holiday special. Unfortunately my wife had an accident where she broke two ribs (not at the resort) and the concern from all staff members was gratefully appreciated. Dewi thanks for roses you sent up the room, it was a lovely gesture;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Rohit Goverdhan;Touch of Lavishness;This is an amazing property in Kuta, Bali. It is on the main Kuta Street with plenty of Shops, Restaurants, Bars.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Shafira A;Best hotel in Kuta;The hotel is very aesthetic, has luxurious ambiences, clean, neat and looks new. Located strategically in Kartika Plaza street. The staffs were very very very polite and friendly. They always greeted whenever we passed them. The amenities are completed (no iron available though..), there are 4 swimming pools and a private beach (although not recommended to swim, more suit to sunbathing). The breakfast was good (especially the traditional ones) although they served the same menu everyday. Overall, it was wonderful experience to stay at Anvaya..;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Rebecca F;Gorgeous hotel great for young couples;The Anvaya was fantastic. Great location. Once side offers the beach & the other entrance offers loads of shops, restaurants, markets. The room was a fair size for us. The bed was absolutely huge & very comfy! The hotel is only 2 years old so everything was very new. The bathrooms were spotless with loads of complimentary toiletries (nail files, mouth wash ext). Loads of movie channels in english which was great for when relaxing in the room. The pool area is gorgeous, the staff are always around if you need snacks or drinks (however can take some time). The hotel was fairly busy when we stayed however the pool was never overly busy and there were plenty of sun loungers. Theres always upbeat music by the pool which is nice. At night time we were able to sit at the beach and;5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Guiterez mar;Wonderful Escape , New Resort in Kuta;this new resort tried me and family to come here. firstly the security service was less friendly considering it is a 5 star hotel. as we entered the sands restaurant we were greeted warmly by the waiter who served us very friendly and polite. we enjoyed our lunch menu, good food and fresh drinks and unique welcome drinks. clean resort atmosphere and kuta beach view. despite being in the heart of the crowded kuta but this resort provides an atmosphere that is so impressive with the music during the afternoon by the beach. this resort is suitable for vacation and close to shopping center and airport. the building is new and natural. immaculate gardens, a pool and a beautiful beach!;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;jadmi;Best of Both Worlds;"Anvaya Beach Resort is 10 minutes from the airport (INR 30,000-50,000 by taxi or INR 200,000 by hotel pick up). It has almost 500 rooms;30sqm Deluxe Rooms facing one of the 5 pools and 35sqm Premiere Rooms closer to the beach with a separate restaurant for breakfast. Just outside the hotel is Kuta with many restaurants, shops, Discovery/Lipo Mall and Waterbom Waterpark are just a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Check-in was personal (you sit at a table with the receptionist who checks you in), fast, friendly and efficient. A cold towel and a welcome drink is given upon check in. The lobby is big with many waterfalls. The staff is all dressed in white which in my opinion looked like hospital personnel rather than hotel staff. INR 150,000 is required security which can be blocked";5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;katecampbell106;It doesn’t get better than the Anvaya;This hotel is everything my partner and I dreamed of! The whole resort is spotlessly clean, the rooms are beautiful, the breakfast is extraordinary and if you decide to have any further meals, the food is of the highest standard. The Service really is the cherry on top! Each and every staff member is a credit to the ANVAYA and is hands down the best we have ever experienced. The Customer Service is sublime. We have had the pleasure of great service throughout our travels all over SEA, however, The Service here cannot be beaten. We both thoroughlly enjoyed relaxing by the pool and being looked after by the all the staff, where nothing was too much for anyone. The Happy Hour served some fantastic cocktails and value for money and the sunset sessions on the beach were a great;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Sugandhasingh;Lagoon access rooms are awesome;Great place to stay back and relax in Kuta. Doesn’t even feel like you are in the middle of the city. Warm staff and very nice rooms. Especially the lagoon access rooms in which we stayed. There was problem with the check out, and it got delayed by almost an hour because there was shortage of staff to take out the luggage, but they apologised for it and were helpful after that too. Breakfast was nice. The main attraction is the beach access that comes with the resort. And there’s shopping mall and Main Street at walking distances.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Ivan W;Fantastic hotel in a great location;I only had the opportunity to stay for one night but I can definitely recommend the hotel as a lovely place to stay and will stay here again if i'm back in Bali. the hotel itself is modern and maintained to a high standard. The rooms are very nice as are the hotel's facilities. The position on the beach is great and the restaurants are very good. One fantastic addition feature is their departure lounge - a lounge area with showers, etc. for use after you've checked out but if you have a late flight.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Carol P;When you thought things couldn’t get better;This hotel has become my family’s favorite hotel in Bali. My husband and I came back for a short break in May and was welcomed by the staff who had remembered us from our visit last year, this was an amazing, restful trip which was made extra special when we released baby turtles back into the ocean. My daughter and I made another trip in June a special treat for my birthday it was her first visit and immediately she could see why we love this hotel, she said it seemed like I was famous because staff members were welcoming me back and remembered my name. I was’nt very well the first few days but the staff including management (Agus) had lemon,ginger and honey either sent to our table or to our room to help me recover. The hotel has started to have a sundowner on the beach each;5;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Jarrad D;Excellent Resort in Kuta!;We stayed here for 9 nights on our second trip to Bali and loved it! The resort was extremely well maintained and modern with all the comforts you would expect. The resort offered multiple pools to swim in along with a good variety of dining options, which were all good. Of note was the daily buffet breakfast that had an excellent variety and the quality of food was good. The room itself was not overly big, however it was still a good size for two people. The bed was comfy and the range of pillows offered great. We were on the top floor in a Premier room which offered good views of the Ocean and back into the main part of the resort. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, more than willing to make any suggestions to make your holiday better. The only small negative;5;0;0;1;0;0;1

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Miguel S;Second Visit As Good As the First;This is the second time my family & I have stayed at the amazing and wonderful Anvaya Beach Resort. The first time we stayed was back in July/August 2017 and the fact that we are return guests says something. The check-in process is always seamless, so as long as you time it right and not when there has been a bus dropping off a large group of guests. Our room was a premium room #2206. It overlooks the main garden area which is lovely when you sit out on the balcony in the afternoon enjoying a pre-dinner drink. The room is spacious for it's size and the bathroom amenities featuring Acca Kappa are luxurious. It's a bonus that the mini bar is replenished daily with soft drinks and juices (not alcohol).

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;zedsgp;Fabulous Hotel with warmth reception from the staffs!;My partner and I stayed in the Premier Suite room from 2nd till 7th July. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay from check-in to check-out. The reception from the staffs are all warmth, sincere and helpful. They greeted with smiles whenever they meet the guests there. As we stayed in the Premier Suite, we could go to both the Sands and Kunyit restaurants. The serving at both joints are massive and full of varieties. I would also like to express my appreciation to Mbak Dewi Cakra, Mbak Ari for arranging a surprise birthday cum romantic dinner for my partner and I. I've already intended to surprise my partner for her birthday, and with the arrangement made my the staffs exceeded both of our expections.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Ryandcruz;Mini oasis in the heart of Kuta;We stayed in a Premiere Room for 4 nights from 3-7 July. We were picked up from the airport by Anvaya. The ride was comfortable and I liked the fact that the driver was dressed in traditional Balinese outfit. Good first impression. The resort is hardly 10 mins away from the airport & the roads leading to the hotel are narrow and congested. But once we reached the entrance, we were blown away. There is strict checking at the entrance which kept us at ease as far as security is concerned. Then you are greeted with a long driveway, surrounded by trees and greenery, until you reach the entrance of the hotel where the eager bellboys are ready to cart off your bags.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;LinlyHay;Beyond our expectations;What a beautiful resort! I really couldn’t fault it. The staff were very professional, friendly and would go above and beyond to ensure your needs were met. We stayed in the pool delux room which opened up to a private pool for quests in that area however, we preferred the main pool as there is more atmosphere and of course the view and smell of the ocean. Windu and Mede were awesome! There are other pool access rooms that we would have preferred as they led into a pool from your rooms doorstep so just check that before booking. However, the room was lovely, a little smaller than usual however, it had everything we needed, was very modern and the bedding was luxurious. Appreciated the little touches like a good morning message on the tv and shaped towel art created by Anwar.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Nzs9;Fantastic hotel!;What a lovely place to stay!! Staff fantastic, room clean. Several lovely pools, we had a pool access room to one of the smaller pools which was lovely as half the time we had the pool pretty much to ourselves! We had welcome drinks and towels provided by the pool too. The sands restaurant was fantastic, really good food and very reasonable priced. The evening entertainment last night with a young man and his band was really lovely! And the restaurant and entertainment is right on the beach front! We had breakfast at the Kuyunti restaurant which had plenty of choice. Make sure you brew your own tea and ask for cold milk if your British as they do make it weak and frothy! The room itself is nice with a lovely shower and comfy firm bed! The Wi-Fi is good all over the resort;5;1;0;1;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;ACT8;My New Bali Home Away From Home;Step in off busy Jl. Kartika Plaza and through the foyer to gorgeous, well maintained gardens and swimming pools. If you keep walking you hit the easy access steps down to the beach where the water is welcoming too. Compared to another hotel we had just stayed three nights at and spent just about double the price for, the Anvaya Beach Resort is well worth every cent, penny, rupiah or whatever currency you are accustomed to.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

The hotel itself is so modern, clean and the rooms are beautiful. We ended up spending our first day in Bali around the pool as it was so pretty. The breakfast and dining room were also incredible. Would definitely recommend, the perfect hotel close to the airport. We paid around £85 for the room for 1 night, and around 150rp for the taxi from the airport (think we could have got this slightly cheaper) use the blue bird company don’t take the first taxi you see!.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

The breakfast buffet was AMAZING with options for every cuisine, every taste bud and every dietary requirement. The service was superb - Prian our server for the 5 days we were there was superb. Every staff member works so hard at pleasing and taking care of all requests. The management is also fantastic - one morning when breakfast was a little busier than usual, a manager went around to each table in this HUGE restaurant apologizing that it was so busy and making sure we got all that we needed. All the food is made fresh, very authentic and wholesome. The rooms are serviced twice a day, front desk staff are just the best. You will not be disappointed in any way.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;liviaflorentina;Very nice place, but far from relaxing concept I had;When I choose the hotel, it was very important for me that it has private send beach and the profile picture was amaizing, with the view from the pool over the see...an infinite pool. We arrived at the midnight and they made the check in instantly, but not before asking for a 400 dolars deposit. It happened to ask this only in China, but for a less amount of money..100 dolars, and it took at least one month for our bank to take them back. In Thailland we gave a 100 dollars deposit last year.. So, for a 27 hours traveller was not a good news to find that he has to give that money for recovering them in one month or more. We explained that to the receptionist and he accepted to make the check in without that..was a plus. Regarding the hotel there are pluses and minuses..I am;4;1;0;0;0;0;0

Few points where this resort gets thumbs up- 1) It has perfect location near the airport, yet zero noise of the air traffic. 2) It has ample of eating joints near by. 3) Lots of street shopping around. 4) Discovery Mall and Lippo mall are at walking distance. 5) Private Beach which is clean too 6) It has two restaurants- Kunyit Restaurant and beach front Sands Restaurant 7) The concierge was very helpful.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Jason F;Very Nice Stay;I prefer smaller hotels than this but it was hard to pass up on the Anvaya from a value-for-money perspective. The room upgrade to deluxe allows access to the Sands restaurant. Based on four vacations to Bali and many hotels used, i would suggest that this was probably the best and most well rounded buffet breakfast that I have found. Traditional, Western, Indonesian, East Indian dishes, etc. Compose your own soup, dim sum, pastry, sushi, etc. Round it out. Fresh fruit, juices, and a custom juice/smoothie station complete it. Lovely. Rooms were nice, clean, staff attentive, and located on the beach with direct access to the beach walk. A little South of the main Tubab/Kuta hustle, convenient also to the airport. My only complaints are noisy corridors, and doors that;4;1;1;0;1;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Emma K;Awesome hotel made the holiday staying here;Fantastic resort from the moment you leave the hustle and bustle of Kuta’s street and walk through the opulent entrance and foyer. Private beach, outstanding staff and service. Highly recommend you stay in a premier room or above as deluxe rooms are away from main area. We stayed in premier room and loved the buffet breakfast at Sands Restaurant. We spent a lot of time at the resort and ate nearly every meal there as it was so fresh and delicious. Pools are so relaxing. I could go on and on, I was worried I would not like Bali but this resort sealed it for me. We will be back. Special mention to Sands Restaurant staff Ngurah (Jack), Windu and Sandi you made us feel like family and so welcome. Thank you for a holiday my partner and I will not forget.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Wizzya;Our favourite hotel in Bali;This was our second visit to Bali and we choose Anvaya again for first 3 nights. We were already familiar with the hotel facilities which is 10/10. We requested Airport pickup which cost $20 but unfortunately no one was there to pick us up, upon calling the hotel they sent us a vehicle right away and apologised to us and waived the $20 fee. This time we had booked 2 premier room with lagoon access, and we loved it. Rooms was spacious and clean, all the essential amenities were provided.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Yacine;Recommend, overall good hotel;The Hotel is nice, pretty big, with a good looking design and well located in Kuta (also not far from airport). Stayed for 3 nights, the overall impression was good. The hotel has like 3-4 pools and beach access. The pools are good, not crowded but they’re a bit shallow. They beach was ok, just pretty annoying with random people waking you up to offer a massage or to sell you something a bit too often. The hotel breakfast was the best part in my opinion. Was very surprised by the amount of choice offered here, very good breakfast and good breakfast location too. The hotel restaurants are ok, but nothing exceptional. Out of the hotel gate, by taking a left there will be plenty of restaurants. The room design is nice and amenities are good as well, but the room size was small.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;bhaavesh2015;Nice Location & New Property;We stayed at interconnection Premiere rooms . Thumbs up: Property: The property is new and well maintained. Pools: the best part of the resort are the three main pools. Concierge: Mr. Rafael at the Concierge was very informative and helpful. Location: It is in the heart of the city with two malls at walking distance and ample of restaurants( even Indian) and shopping around. Beach: This resort has clean private beach. They also have beach front restaurant. Activities: They have great activities going on. Water acrobatics, cycling tour till kuta square, yoga by the sea, are few activities we participated. Thumbs down: Breakfast at the Sands Restaurant: Indian food for breakfast needs to be improvised. They have upma/ poha and masala dhosa for breakfast;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Odreytan;Buffet was great;First time, staying at anvaya. The front desk can’t find our booking even though ms dhiana ( the GM Secretary) has sent us the email confirmation It is little bit take a while to sort it out but the good thing they upgrade the room to recovery the incident. The hotel nice and clean. We had a nice dinner at nite in your beach club. And next morning since we were staying at premier room, they were allowed us to choose the restaurant we want to have breakfast. Either in beach club or in the kunyit...we chose again to the resto at beach club again for buffet and as usual ( we are a picky person) when it goes to buffet, but this time we were happy as see so many variant food in the restaurant. Our staying was great. Happy with cleaness and happy tummy. Well done the Anvaya!;4;0;0;0;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Sylvie972018;Stunning hotel and amazing staff;The hotel is stunning and simply exceeded my expectation. I have stayed at some amazing hotels and this resort sits comfortably among my favourites. Check in was very quick and easy. The room was clean and serviced daily and the bed was extremely comfortable. The food was delicious and the resort grounds were immaculately kept. Everything was memorable but the service stood out as one of the best experiences and represented the epitome of Balinese hospitality, genuine friendliness and care. The staff honestly made the resort a wonderful experience. Nothing was overlooked and the welcoming smiles and pleasure on the faces of the staff was outstanding. Huge thank you to Anita, Krisna, Dewi, Mawi, Fanny, Agust, Febi and Indras as they went above and beyond to make me feel;5;0;0;1;1;1;1

Great, quiet location close to all that Kuta has to offer without the bogan element. Rooms are very comfortable. Breakfast is breathtaking. Services within the resort itself are great. The staff. Well the are quite simply fantastic. Every staff member greets you constantly and wants to talk to you to ensure your stay is memorable. Dewi Prama working the breakfast shift is fantastic. Remembering everyone’s names is one thing but her overall attitude and attention to the customers needs no matter what country they come from is very very professional.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Rahardjo;A romantic gateway;The food are just georgous. We had tenderloin and kung pao chicken. Spent two hours in the restaurant with live music. The room is spacious. Love the rain shower. Love the idea of them storing luggage in the bathroom so the bedroom is just not messy with luggage. Everything is digitized. Food ordering through the tv as well. It might be difficult for some ppl. The bed is just comfortable and the bfast is good. The checkout is slow as there were a lot of ppl checking out at the same times.;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Mich6650;Great Hotel in an excellent Location;The hotel itself is great with warm welcoming staff. We stayed in the lagoon access room which allowed us direct access to the lagoon - which was great however the water was too cold for us to swim in. The room is not huge but will its ok for a couple days stay. We had the opportunity to try both The Sands and Kunyit for breakfast - the sands provided more variety and more international choises but was very crowded. Kunyit on the other hand had more local balinese food and was less hectic. The hotel grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Easy access to many restaurants and malls around the area.;4;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;jingga18;A Wonderful Experience All Around;The Anvaya Resort is a wonderful establishment at Kuta with direct access to the beach. It has a great pool area with floating pillows, which were really popular with the kids. The breakfast buffet boasted a great selection of both local and international foods. The sleep quality was one of the best I’ve had at any hotel. The thing that kept me from giving this hotel a perfect score was the layout. The room was a little bit on the small side for a Bali resort. There’s barely enough space for our two small luggages. And the bathroom was not the most spacious, nor did it have a comfortable layout.;4;0;1;0;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Mas S;You should stay here!;I was staying in Anvaya Beach Resort - Bali and from my personal experience, i had a great experience when i was staying in Anvaya Beach Resort - Bali. All the facilities, services and foods was excellent especially their Balinese hi-tea!! I was invited to try out their Balinese hi-tea at Kunyit Restaurant and Sand & Wine Cellar. I was impressed and really enjoy the food that i had during those hi-tea, especially at the Kunyit Restaurant since that was my first time having a hi-tea that served in traditional way. Not also the food, the service from their staff was also great. While waiting the food to be served, their staff treat me with a decent Balinese smile and hospitality. All fabulous, You should stay here!;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Jeff C;Most hotels/resorts are competitive BUT...;The staff here are the difference makers! I stayed here with my wife from 9May to 16May and the resort is amazing. With it's multiple pools and steps from the beach I didn't want to leave. Did I mention the morning buffet? The menu here is rotated daily from fresh fruit and juice station to a variety of American, Japanese, Chinese, Indian and other cultures. The rooms were fantastic and well AC'd upon our arrival which was late in the afternoon. The facilities are WELL maintained and the resort is surrounded by a variety of restaurants and shopping. Only thing I would say that did not measure up to the rest of the quality of the resort was the signage... Many signs were not levelled and so it did not equate with the standard of the rest of the resort.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

The both of them along with the other staff made my birthday very very special. The food is great at this hotel. The breakfast is ammmazzzinnng!! I also treated myself to the spa which was wonderful.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Kobus69;The best;This quality beach front resort was the perfect choice. The hotel is fresh, clean and modern. The location is great. To the front, it is on a quiet beach and a short stroll to the bustling Kuta beach. The beautiful entrance is on a shopping district in downtown Kuta. It also has a fabulous street front restaurant. The main restaurant, where breakfast is served, is beautiful and located on the beachfront. Talking about breakfast: the variety on offer is FANTASTIC. A real feast to start your day. We had a deluxe room with a wonderful comfortable kingsize bed. The complimentary extras they offer is a real treat.;5;0;1;0;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Luke Leeroy L;Probably the best hotel n resorts in Kuta;We stayed here from 8-10 May. At first I wasn’t sure about this hotel because we arrived at night and we straight away sleep. In the next morning we ate our breakfast at one of the restaurant not KUNYIT. We were amazed many selections and the food is superb. My suggestion if you are travelling with family try the premier room with twin bed and ask the reception to combine the bed and trust me you will sleep like a baby. (+) spacious bed and comfortable, strong running water, private beach, nice breakfast, good location, friendly staff, excellent toiletries. (-) store room for the luggage inside the toilet, long walking distance from the car park to the hotel.;5;0;1;0;1;0;1

The free breakfast buffet is amazing (even includes a juice bar). As most international flights leave late at night, I dropped my suitcase at the front and was planning on spending the day at the pool. When I was done at the pool, they told me they had a waiting area for guests waiting on their flights. This included showers with all the amenities; drinks; snacks. All of the staff were amazing.

The resort is always clean and the staff always greet me with a smile and say hello. I have been here a number of times and I see the same staff still here which is always nice to see. I was greeted by Windu at the pool bar and he instantly recognized me and my wife. He is very friendly and happy to help me. Good staff are hard to find. I hope the resort gives them all a pat on the back. I look forward to coming back soon and seeing the same faces and the beautiful resort.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Shameemah H;Loved! Loved Loved.;We stayed in the lagoon access pools which was absolutely amazing. The room is functional and pleasant. The garden view is so peaceful and the best part being the walk in pool was an absolute luxury. I loved loved it. Just a tip - book the lagoon access or facing rooms. The pool access is nice and cheaper but a bit away from the main part of the hotel and when you walk to the room you walk pass a concrete wall which isn't so great. The buffet breakfast for pool access rooms are also at a different restaurant. But whichever room you book, the staff are an absolute coolness.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

The bathrooms are huge, with closet space, luggage rack inside. There's rain shower but not a bath tub. The mini bar is well stocked with a variety of complimentary soft drinks. The hotel is located right on the beach and has a boardwalk for walking/cycling around the beach. You can rent bicycles from the hotel. It is also in the middle of kuta market and at a walking distance from various nice restaurants, mall, tattoo studios, spas and shops. You can take your pick and try whatever you like,;5;0;1;0;1;0;1

Try booking the premier rooms and the ones above it because people staying in the premier rooms have access to more facilities. This hotel has very friendly staff and you can even rent bicycles to go cycling along the coast line. The location of this hotel is amazing.

The resort is very close to the airport, which made transfers as painless as can be expected (the airport seems to always have traffic around). The staff was not just polite - they were all incredibly friendly. It was not possible to walk down a hallway without being greeted. The grounds were immaculate.

Rooms are fantastic and the pools are so clean and refreshing. Kuta is a little bit honky tonk for my taste, but it was definitely lively. This is a great spot for families.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Robert M;Best in Bali;Just had our second stay at the Anvaya, the minute we walked back in we felt so welcomed. The staff remembered us and were genuinely excited to see us. We felt so relaxed sitting in the restaurant overlooking the ocean, complete peace and serenity away from busy Kuta out the front. From the moment you drive in security is very tight as cars and drivers are all checked. Check-in is completed swiftly whilst you relax with a welcome drink and beautifully perfumed cold towel. The rooms are large and well air conditioned, and the numerous pools are clean, cool and inviting. The buffet breakfast is five star and has a huge variety. Whilst I was there i got sick due to a condition that I suffer. The staff did everything they could to help me feel comfortable;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Marty3205;Good value for money;It’s a relatively new hotel and so the facilities are great and it looks very nice. It was also very clean. Centrally located and access to the beach it’s hard to fault what you get in terms of value for money. Because it’s a big hotel I found there were a lot of particularly noisey tourists (Chinese) who didn’t care how much noise they made or where they smoked. Key card and door lock repeatedly didn’t work and the buffet food was okay.;4;1;1;0;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;parisazare;Can’t fault a thing;I write this I sit by the beautiful pool surrounded by wonderful staff who really will do anything to help. From the moment we arrived we have been treated exceptionally.

Looking forward to the rest of our stay here.;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Kathy A;Great moment with my Daughter;This place as an amazing room, view and breakfast. Close to the restaurant, surrounded by swimming pool and at the edge you can find their private beach. I was travelling with my 4year daughter, their king size bed big enough for two of us. They have kid’s club with 3 computers which contain games for kids, puzzle, drawers full of toys, restroom for kids, and outside, at the outdoor area they have a small swimming pool and sand playground. You can use some swimming property for free. They have a big room, quite big bed and nice bathroom. Their hotel amenities is my favorite, equal with Trans Luxury’s amenities quality. Few times stays in this hotel, either for pleasure or work, their checkin process quite long as long as the checkout process. So you must be patient and;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;rmsyd;Genuine Elegant Balinese Experience with no trashy Australians;Anvaya is the newest largest resort in Kuta. It is located very close to the airport but we never heard or saw any aircraft and it was much better than staying in Seminyak, having to plod an hour through town. It is only about five minutes to the airport, cheap and easy. The coastal walk -towards- the airport is gorgeous and full of charming elegant seaside restaurants and bars, and there was plenty of shopping nearby, and a ten minute walk to busy central Kuta. Carla Spa and Matahari, a five minute walk. We dont actually go swimming in the dirty ocean along that coast, and the beaches were surprisingly fine. We also never saw a single typical bogan Australian tourist on the grounds, mostly respectable looking and behaved Indonesians and other Asians.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;garydavidg;Awesome;Without doubt this place would be the best hotel we have ever stayed at. 5 star for sure. We had a premier lagoon access and it was perfect. We were upgraded to a suite but we live in a remote part of Australia and we enjoyed people watching and being amongst the action. The food was wonderful especially breakfast it had so much variety. The staff are all so helpful and friendly nothing was a problem. At Breakfast I was welcomed by my name which was a surprise. I can’t remember the name of the man that waited on us at breakfast but one morning I was delivered my coffee and my name was written in it. I tried to find him on our last day to tip him but no success. Thank you Anyaya for a wonderful holiday we loved it.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Maria Gabriela;SANDS RESTAURANT - Definitely will come back again!;"Last week, I went to Sands Restaurant with few of my best-friend for short weekend escape! too boring with crowded Canggu and Seminyak area! all we need is uncrowded-beachfront pool, pizza, and young coconut in hand! Then, when scrolling down to my instagram-timeline I found Anvaya and the picture seems promising! We enjoyed our time chilling by their more-than-one cozy pool overlooked to the ocean views, thanks to its location! The services was amazing, their friendly staff served us with their proactive gesture makes us felt like home! Must to try their delightful Fettuccine Carbonara pasta and Margarita pizza! (couldn't ask for more) Special thanks to Dewa and team who assist us during our leisure time in the pool! anyway, we love the floating bean bag in the pool ;)";5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;SunSoulTraveller;Modern resort with some lovely features;We spent one night here before having to fly back to Australia - we wanted somewhere nice, but close to the airport too. The rooms were really lovely - very comfy beds of a generous size. I liked that housekeeping stop by in the afternoon to see if you need any top ups of water bottles (free), tea, coffee or anything else. Because you only drink bottled water here, it was a wonderful gesture. I've travelled quite a bit, and it was the first time I've seen a hotel which has a room service ordering system from the television.;4;0;1;0;1;0;1

The hotel is huge, and has a nice pool and beach. We stayed in Premiere Room with balcony and fantastic view. Room was spacious enough and very well cleaned. The bed was comfortable. Bathroom is large with complete amenities. Breakfast was gorgeous, with plenty to choose. We dined at Sands Restaurant. They had a good and affordable regular menu and live music The hotel has 2 restaurants, Kunyit Restaurant (at road side/near the gate) for Indonesian food and Balinese food, and Sand Restaurant (at beach side) for Western food.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Shero V;Amazing Hotel!;We were there for one week in oct 2017. I think it is the most luxury hotel in kuta. It takes 10 min from airport and discovery shopping center. The beach was amazing.The pool was nice. The room was very clean with a huge bed, nice balcony, very good air conditioning system and all the facilities provided. The sand restaurant was awsome. We had breakfast every day at there. Finally i want to thank Anvaya Beach Resort Bali and i hope i can be there again.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;AJ M;Memorable hotel;I love this hotel, place is close to everything and this resort is luxurious. We got upgraded to the beach front room since there was some electrical problem with ours and it was perfect. We had our own private pool and the bathroom was huge. It has a separate shower area,toilet area and the bath tub is also situated outside separately. The bedroom is spacious enough for 3. It has its own living area and we received welcome chocolates and fruits. the location is suitable for everything. Close to mall,shops, restos and not far from kuta beach,parking space is also available.for motorbikes (we rented one in a local shop 20 meters away from the hotel to the right) staff is exstremely kind and helpful. The only negative point i can come up with might be that its quite a stroll;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Bed was huge. Bathroom was very modern. All toiletries are included. Towels big and fluffy. Pools were lovely. Plenty of sun lounges. We had breakfast included at the Sands Restaurant which was an awesome buffet. We did find a few things not so good The hotel corridors were noisey around midnight we would hear people going back to rooms, im sure most had high heeled shoes which tapped through the hallways on our floor and above floors for hours every night.. Also our neighbouring room sounded like they were dragging the chair back and forth around their room every night -;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Daniel S;Nice 2nd visit;Stay for 2 nights in December at the Lagoon Access Room. Had the same great service that I had during my previous stay in July. Breakfast selection was great, kid's club was great as before, ample swimming pool access for everyone, especially to us, since we have the access to the lagoon. In short, a very good 2nd experience. The only drawback is the location, which is a bit off from Kuta area. But if you're travelling with family and want to enjoy a quiet and relaxing place to stay, this hotel is definitely a good place to stay.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;elune21;Good Location, Family Friendly and Breakfast Choices;Room Reviews: We stayed at this hotel from 27 - 30 Dec 2017 and booked 2 of their Deluxe Room.

All Deluxe Room located in other building that near to one of their restaurant (Kunyit Restaurant) and front side of Hotel Lobby (parking area) not near to the private beach and their main swimming pool. But there's dedicated swimming pool located in the building where all Deluxe Room is located. The bed is big, have balcony if you stay at upper level, the amenities that hotel provide is complete.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;pmheva;Great place to stay with friendly staff,;Welcoming emails before we arrived ‘Dear Welcomed Guest’ informing us of what festivities are available. Never had that before. The buffet breakfast is plentiful with an amazing choice from Indonesian, Asian, European and Western. The pastries are mouth watering, all with a view of the beach. Poolside the place to be in the hottest part of the day. Our room had a massive kingside bed, free minibar and was kept immaculate and cool. Just a quick walk along the paved beachfront (joggers path)to Lippo Mall and Discovery Shopping Centre-cooling breeze at night. Street front walk has Warungs, local shops, day spas for a relaxing facial and foot massage, if heading left the Waterbom park and plenty of places for a cold Bintang/Bali Hai or an icy fruit juice.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;OperaK;A Jewel Amongst All of Kuta Beach;I must confess that, I haven’t set foot in the Kuta Bali area for a while now, at least 15 years and I go to Bali a few times a year, last December was an anomaly. The Anvaya Beach Resort Bali is located along the busy Kuta beach stretch, however I found peace and tranquility in this property, perhaps due to Mount Agung’s recent eruptions. But, a walk on the beach, further into the heart Kuta reveals a different vibes, which is the usual busy crowd and tourists. So I would highly recommend that, if you want some peace and tranquility and still needing the usual convenience of food outlets and coffee shops nearby, plus beach fronting, then go for the Anvaya Bali at Kuta.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Michael E;Recommended resort in a busy street;Arrived at the resort around 2.30 pm and check in process was smooth and I got room 2537 with partial sea view, so you can see the sunset from the room. Minibar is free and replenished daily so it is a plus side for me rather than have to stock up on water/drink during my stay, Breakfast is great with awesome choices at the Sands Restaurant. I also try the dinner in the Sands, however the menu choice is rather small and they served mostly Western Food. Just a bit downside is that the beach is pretty dirty so if I may suggest that the hotel employ someone to ensure the cleanliness of the beach. Another small downside is that they don't provide valet parking and between the parking garage and the lobby is around 4 minutes walk. Finally, I enjoyed my 5 nights stay here and;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Michael, Herny & Mitchell;Great hotel at perfect location;We spend New Years Eve at the Anvaya. Travelling by car in Bali on New Years Eve is not a good idea, so go there very early! The hotel is simply great and offers everything you expect from a 5-star-hotel: welcoming staff, spacious and clean rooms with lots of luxury, great breakfast buffet with ample choices of all kinds of foods, a large pool, direct beach access etc. The hotels location is really great. From the hotel you walk either along the beach or the beach promenade road along which you find many restaurants, bars, shops and 2 large shopping center. You dont need a car and can thus escape the Bali traffic. The hotel is more popular among Locals, which we liked a lot.;5;0;1;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Ree G;5 Star hotel 6 Star service;We went to Bali this trip for a rest after a very hard year. What a surprise we received when we arrived at the Anvaya! The photos on the web site really don't give you a proper look at the hotel No false advertising but so much better than any photo The service level given by the staff is out of this world! The number of guest was low but this did not deter the staff their morale was high and they were warm friendly, with out being intrusive and so helpful. Our room was comfortable clean and well lit. The bed was so very comfortable and this was a premier room not the deluxe. Water was supplied in the room and a phone call had it replenished the same day if needed.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;ausrose;Some Things Great, Some Things Not So Great!;Generally speaking we had a good experience at this new hotel. We had a Deluxe Pool Access room and while it was modern and comfortable I found it a little cramped, the big bed took up most of the room while the bathroom, though well designed was also rather cramped. The bathroom was also strangely dark even though there was plenty of lights none of them were very strong , mainly it was lacking natural light - in my deepening middle age with associated poor eye sight I was finding it hard to effectively put on my make up etc. However the fact that our room was just a few steps away from a lovely swimming pool made up for it and most of the time we seemed to be the only ones enjoying the pool.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;JAFSydney;Good Hotel;While Anvaya it is at the higher end of the price range you do get what you pay for. It is a big hotel with plenty of space around. All staff and amenties were extremely good including plenty of choices at breakfast. It's in a great location and you can easily walk along the oceanside path at the back of the hotel into Kuta without having to navigate traffic. I have one very small suggestion, as there is nowhere to hang wet swimmers and the like so maybe the installation of one of those pull out clothes line in the bathroom would be great. Would stay again if my budget permitted. Cheers ....;4;1;0;1;0;0;0

Infact the breakfast is virtually served on the beach front. Great checking in, fantastic room. We could actually walk in from our bed and swim in the lagoon. Breakfast spread was good.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Tholi84;Best Hotel of our journey;We stayed just one night but this night was really great. If we come back to Bali, we will again stay in Anvaya Beach Resort. The rooms are very comfortable, the stuff very helpful and friendly, the facilities are very clean and the breakfast was also unforgettable. Even the communication afterwards via mail with Helmy Shaukany was very helpful. We can really recommend this place. In addition, it was very close to the airport without hearing any disturbing noises. Great stay! Thanks a lot!;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Jon L;Anvaya;We visited Bali 5 yrs ago and stayed in the original santika beach resort. I must say the new Anvaya is beautiful and staff very friendly when we arrived, the only negative for me where is the swim up bar??? We enjoyed our daily buffet breakfast 10/10 yum, I would like to thank Dewi Prama for her smiling face ever morning and making our breakfast enjoyable. Manager Agus Ardana went out of his way to make our stay fantastic , and thankyou for everything you done during our stay much appreciated my friend.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Julie O;Absolutely wonderful!;"A friend and I purchased a Groupon deal through Great Value Vacations, we paid for the upgrade, and I'm so glad we did! We stayed at The Anvaya for 7 nights, so we were able to really experience the hotel's facilities and issue resolves. First, the staff was so kind, happy, and helpful. Second, the grounds were absolutely gorgeous, so serene and manicured. Third, the selection of cuisine was vast and delicious! The two issues (yes, only two in 8 days) were: 1.) A king size bed, when requesting a double-bed room; this was resolved immediately, and we stayed on the 3rd floor, pool view, with a balcony, and double beds. 2.) A confusion regarding a free box/bag breakfast for a tour vs. a room-service charge; the hotel's manager was able to resolve the issue and take the charge off.";5;1;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;yeungman;Superb Resort!;Our family group booked deluxe rooms at The Anvaya Beach Resort for our Oct 20th stay. Unfortunately the rooms assigned to us have terrible lingering smoke smell which caused us headaches and nausea. The housekeeping staff did their best to spray the rooms twice (while we went shopping) but the smoke smell still lingered. Finally, the night manager, Patriawan, came to check and agreed that the smoke smell was bad. He upgraded us to Premier rooms and even helped to move our luggage to our new rooms. What great service and hospitality befitting a 5-star resort hotel! We love the swimming pools and the food selection at the Sands Restaurant. The resort, which is fairly new, is superb! We will definitely return to the Anvaya when we next visit Kuta, Bali!;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Srbdhawan;Amazing property;Our stay at Anavaya beach resorts was amazing. we had booked Premiere suite room which was overlooking the ocean from the balcony. The property is new and well-maintained.location is near to the airport and on the busy street of Kuta yet seems to be quiet inside.It is a modern hotel with a touch of Balinese style of ambiance. Check in took time as the rooms were not ready even at 2.pm in the afternoon. The room was huge with 3 LED, 2 in the room and one in washroom above the bathtub. Washroom is huge with white marble flooring and walls. Breakfast was at the Sands resort by the beach and had something for every taste. It also has in-house spa facility where you can relax after the busy day. The popular photograph circulated online with Pool overlooking the beach is only;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;kit5964;Kevin;We have stayed at a lot of hotels in Bali over the past 35years and without a doubt this is my favourite. The rooms we had (Lagoon access and Pool access) are very well appointed and very comfortable, I would recommend the Lagoon access. It has all you need and the wifi is good. Staff are fantastic and the Breakfast restaurant is brilliant with an excellent selection and I am quite a fussy eater. This is a reasonably new hotel, (The old Santika was here next to the Dynasty) and it is lovely. Pools are great and the staff are helpful, genuinely friendly and the whole experience is 10/10.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Lenggeng Explorer;Awesome Stay;Stayed for 1 night and wish we could stay longer. Meant to be a stopover before our flight home. The hotel is new so the room is very modern and the expected amenities all available. The bellman Agung was very polite and helpful in explaining about the minibar and the tv. The beach is a plus for this hotel. Enjoyed the beach and the access to the beach running track. The buffet breakfast and the staff working the breakfast were very polite. The only thing I'd like improved is the dim light on the stairs and the slippery stairs when it rained.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;shwethamshetty;Beautiful property with the best staff ever;I stayed with my family at Anvaya towards the end of Aug-first week of September 2017. The property is very clean, well maintained and has the best sunset views..Although my favorite part was how the staff made us feel very welcome. Especially at breakfast... my twin nieces were treated to special fruit that they liked, everyone was always smiling and politely ready to help. A special 'thank you' to Indrastutti, who went out of her way to explain Bali traditions and was also kind enough to let me join her in her morning prayers.. Bali is beautiful but its people make it special. Thank you Anvaya;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;193vivekc;Good resort with scenic view;Good resort 10-15 minutes from international Airport. Grand reception area , Good rooms, clean swimming pools , some rooms attached to pools. Nice restaurants , good continental breakfast and food with Indian cuisine also. Bathrooms were big and well planned( though I found some Ants and can be tackled ). Kuta market nearby. Good Indian Queens Restaurant adjoins. What more reasons not to choose the place.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Dian Suri H;Loving the food.;We stayed for a seminar and we were happy! The food is great especially since I'm a vegetarian and I love having so many options!

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;rejirapheal2017;Our unplanned holiday;Awesome place. Awesome stay. We were there for 5 days and we loved it . Beach property very close to the airport as well as market place. Very good and friendly staff. We would love to stay back here . We hardly looked at options before booking this place as it was unplanned . However to our surprise complete value for money . Not too crowded to gives you a lot of space and privacy . Good for honeymoon couples like us;5;1;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Dblister;Couples get away.;We had the best time, love the set out of the resort. Lots of open space, beautiful breeze ways and areas to lounge around. Pools are clean and spacious. Rooms are well set out and the king bed was massive and very comfortable. The pillows are so comfortable!! Breakfast is excellent with lots of options. Great position to get the boats out to surf. Can’t wait to go back.;5;0;0;0;1;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;WanderWendy;Picturesque place;The Anvaya Beach Resort is a sprawling vacation place in Bali with countless rooms that can fit buses of tourists. The rooms are located in wings which have 5 floors, and in the center a reception, a restaurant and a beachfront spot where one can just order a fruit shake and chill. There is another restaurant located by its entrance where we were instructed to have breakfast. The property is just a 5-minute walk from a nearby mall where there are shopping and dining options. We advise this place for a relaxing vacation.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;LynnseyMS;Lovely hotel..but;We stayed at the Anvaya from 16-27 October 2017. The hotel is lovely as it is new and we found the location great. We have been to Bali many times and stayed at a few different Hotels. We had a Deluxe pool room, where you walked out your door to the pool. The pool area was nice and clean and the pool attendants lovely. Could not fault the staff at this hotel. The only downside was the noise. Music was played constantly when the pool was open and we could hear it in our room which which got abit much. We also had people sitting and swimming in the pool when it was closed, late at night and they were so noisy we had to call reception. To fix this, security should do hourly patrols. Our room was comfortable, although small.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;TenKate;Wonderfull hotel, very recommendable! (Stay a day at the pool bar!);Very clean, well located hotel with great facilities and very friendly staff - very recommendable. The breakfast is extensive but because of that a little massively. During the day you almost see no guests. A true hidden gem is the pool bar at the last, 3rd pool before the beach starts. We planned to visit several Beach Clubs but in fact we stayed at the 3rd pool our whole 5 night stay because of the points mentioned below. This is because the wonderful facilities (clean pool, good beds, parasol’s and complimentary towels) good food and no people asking you for a massage or if you want to buy something at all as is private. But definitely because of the employees Windu and Aris from the pool bar who will do anything to make your day as relaxed as possible.;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;ASPal;Accessible Resort!;staffs are friendly and professional at the same time, refinement, time-efficient! Shoutout to Andi, the Front Office Manager for the services through our stay and Ayu Citra for being so flexible (long story short, we had dinner at Sands when suddenly my little daughter fell asleep just right after we ordered, Ayu offered to send the dishes to the room, a troublesome I know but she took care of it swiftly, how thoughtful. + Breakfast choices varies more than I could ever imagined, it’s been awhile since I haven’t had this kind of buffet, usually most of the 5stars we went, served a seriously boring breakfast. Oh yes anyway, Windu (if I got his name right) is another name I have to mention here, went to the pool and he served us quick without having to call a second attendant;5;0;0;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;777kanes;Great resort;Rooms are clean and comfortable beds and pillows. Pools are excellent with lots of seating.

Definitely 5 star Bali and would recommend this hotel.;5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Amanda;Absolutely beautiful resort;We spent 6 nights here and loved every moment. The staff were friendly, welcoming, and attentive. We received a complimentary upgrade to a premium room, which meant that we had breakfast at the Sands restaurant overlooking the ocean each morning - perfect! Not only that, but the buffet has a great range for all tastes. We had lunch by the pool, as well as tapas one afternoon, and dinner one of the evenings at the Sands restaurant. All were delicious. The evening that we had dinner there was also live music, which was great. The resort is on the beach, which is clean and you can walk along to Kuta beach, Legian, or Seminyak. On the street-side of the resort there are a multitude of bars and restaurants, as well as shops. The walk to Kuta central is not far at all, but far enough;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Hanna A;Wonderful resort!!!;I stayed for 1 night only but I can't forget how beautiful this resort. When i checked in the reception gave me free upgrade to premium room, its nice room and the bed so comfy and big. I slept well and the bathroom is big also, i love the bathroom amenities its very luxury and the bath gel smells musk amazing. I know the price bit high for this area cos u can easily find lots of cheaper hotel but I would definitely come back here when i visit bali again just for relaxation and pamper myself.;5;1;0;0;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Mike M;Close to beach and airport;We stayed twice to/from other parts of Indonesia. Once in a pool view room and once in garden view (upgrade). The rooms are spacious, clean and well kept. A/C and internet are good, but the halls with double loaded rooms are noisy. Public areas are nice and breakfast choice is vast! Eat in the beach side restaurant to avoid the noise and heat of the Kunyit Restaurant. The hotel is well located in the tourist area of Bali and therefore is on the beach and close to shopping and a wide variety of restaurants.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;baurs1897;Best clean hotel;Spent 3 nights group trips at Bali Kuta island. Locatation was perfect next to the beach, shopping malls & indian restaurants easy to find. The Kunyit restaurant was good too for Balinese & Indonesian speciality.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

The staff are adorable and make everything special for you. Food from both Resturants is wonderful, top service. THE BED IS SO BIG! loved it so much, new clean hotel. Love!;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Brooke N;Best experience!;My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon from September 26 - October 6. We did a lot of research on hotels and finally settled on The Anvaya. What a fantastic choice. From the moment we walked in, to the moment we left, the staff were nothing but friendly and helpful. Every time we walked past any staff (front desk, gardener, house keeping), we got a big smile and a hello. They were all willing to help in any way possible. The front desk hooked us up with a driver that we LOVED! He showed us places we never would have known about! The breakfast might just have been our favourite part. You are greeted and brought to a table of your choosing where you get your choice of coffee, and then you can head to the biggest and best spread of food we've ever seen.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Had requested by email at least 7 days prior that if available, we would like a higher floor room. Our email was not even acknowledged on time. Were told at check in by the person handling it that it is not available on that day and we would be shifted to one the next day. Before that we were asked if we would like to upgrade to a Premier Room at an additional fee When I expressed my displeasure to the manager Cynthia Dewi, she intervened and gave us the top floor room.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Lauren0106;Simply amazing!;Where to start? This hotel is absolutely fantastic! We stayed for 4 nights in the lagoon access room, which was well worth it! Basically like having your own (semi) private swimming pool. The grounds are immaculately kept and always spotlessly clean. The breakfast is endless and you have an unbelievable selection. The staff are so friendly and always have a welcoming smile. All in all, this place is paradise!;5;0;0;1;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Sarah n Pete R;Great hotel & location;We had originally booked a deluxe poolside room and once we arrived we asked to see a lagoon access room and loved the location of the room so we upgraded to a lagoon access room, this gave us a free mini bar (cool drinks only) which was restocked daily or more if you asked for it. This room also gave you the option of breakfast at both of the breakfast areas at the front & back of the hotel. It was very comfy and the room attendants were very good. We were restocked for towels & mini bar even by evening staff. The treats we got in the evening of chocolate, cookies etc were nice. Staff were Very friendly & always say hello. Grounds & gardens are very well kept & gardeners are always busy. Pool attendants are very friendly and we're happy to give us a glass of ice as we had free;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Also, For anyone travelling to bali , I recommend NOT TO change your money in doggy and unofficial money exchanges ,just because they are showing high rates !it's trap ! It happened to us and the hotel manager and the hotel head of security were really helpful. they came with us to the money exchange and got our stollen money back !!;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Gahhgu G;Amazing Anvaya;Me and my wife was amazed by the warm welcome and friendly staff in the resort. One of the handsome front desk guy greeted us and checked into our room, which also surprisingly upgraded (Premium) due to deluxe room fully booked. The room is cosy and superbly crafted. Every items or edges were meticulously planned for a reason and its usage. In addition, we were presented a tray of quality chocolates and strawberries as a complimentary. The beach was amazing, so does the pool services as well as other facilities e.g Gym. Will definitely come again next year!

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Aimee M;Beautiful new resort, a little too big/impersonal for my taste however that's what it is!;I have never loved huge resorts where as much as the staff are nice enough, you can't help but feel a little like a 'number' versus a valued guest. Many people (obviously!) love being within a large resort however I certainly prefer a more villa /small resort style. They DO offer a more personal/villa type experience however there is only ONE absolute beachfront 'villa' (unsure exactly what they call them) which was booked. There were also around 4-5 more villa style rooms (as opposed to the 'typical hotel rooms' we stayed in, however, again they were booked. While we did book only a few days before, it would be great if they offered these larger/villa/apartment type style rooms. My Dad and I booked into two separate rooms that were 'one level' above standard. The room;4;1;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;tomac1957;Wonderful;We stayed in a lagoon room which was great. If you don't want to use one of the three pools the lagoon is the place to be. The rooms and the rest of the resort is immaculate and the staff are warm and friendly. They have even thought to put a shaving/make up mirror in the bathroom. The breakfast was great, something for everyone. We have stayed in the old Santika and although this hotel has lost a little bit of it's charm it is still outstanding.They offer a lounge with shower to use if you have a late flight even with an early checkout out. The location is great for shopping and the airport is only 10 mins away. We would definatley return.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Excellent Kids Club. Perfect Location - Step outside and you got restaurants, shopping, massages, waterbom etc etc. I will come back. Only improvement I would suggest is the Gym/fitness centre did not have any weight machines, lifting equipment or dumbells which is very unusual for a hotel of this size, bit of a let down for such a great hotel. Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for this.;4;0;0;1;1;1;0

Location was brilliant, access to the beach at the rear of the hotel, staff were brilliant, especially the kids club, my children didn't want to leave as the staff were sooo nice.

From when you arrive ,to everyone you pass, in the restaurants, the pool staff... Everyone is friendly and so helpful. I loved how it felt modern but also has held onto the beautiful spirit of Bali with amazing entertainment, the best restaurant at one end (kunyit) .. Where I ate every night because the food was so amazing!! The activities that honour Balinese tradition. Also loved hanging by the pool with the quiet beachfront and the best sunsets.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Ornchuma I;Great place to stay. Can do better with more check in staffs;I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights during a conference at the hotel. The room was clean and spacious. If you bring children, I recommend the lagood access room. Great variety of breakfast to choose from. Had great egg Benedict in Sunday morning but the same dish was horrible on Monday. No English muffin and lackluster hollandaise sauce. The hotel should have coordinated better with the conference organizer because the check-in staff was very confused about the booking of my additional bed.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Carol P;Above and Beyond;On our last visit to Bali we ate in the Kunyit restaurant I was so impressed, I booked nine nights in a lagoon room and wasn't disappointed. The hotel is a short drive from the airport, and although it's situated on a busy road but set back it is peaceful and it's hard to believe your in Kuta. Our room was very comfortable with a huge bed, good linen and comfy pillows. The wardrobe is situated in the bathroom and I found there wasn't enough storage space for clothing and needed to leave some items in the suitcase.;5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Francois V;Excellent hotel;Second visit to Bali. First time we stayed at The Anvaya Beach Resort in Kuta. A hidden sanctuary in southern Bali! This resort was an absolute treat, meeting our highest travel expectations - and only a short drive from the airport! We were lucky enough to have stayed in one of the Anvaya Suites. Luxurious duplex-style suites with a private pool. Spacious suite with any amenity you can think of... Our suite overlooked the stunning, lush gardens of the resort and pool area. The King sized bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was our favourite! The suite featured an indoor and outdoor bathroom, a separate free-standing bathtub, inside and outside shower and the finest amenities. Breakfast was amazing.;5;0;0;0;1;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Thelma R;Beautiful new hotel;We have just spent 8 wonderful, comfortable, nights here and have NO complaints whatsoever...we had a Scoopon voucher, which included a few extras, to make it a very worthwhile offer. We had stayed at the Santika many times previously and the Anvaya has done itself proud, making one feel at home with friendly and helpful staff in every area. Satrya and his team at The Sands deserve special mention, always making time to check on us and have a chat - the food was always good. And Darma, the gentleman at the front, who previously worked for the Santika hotel, who always remembered our names, after all these years! We can't wait to go back and can recommend to any age group.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;ekawatya;Lovely hotel;This hotel was a new and elegant hotel. It was near the airport, around 10 minutes if there was no traffic jam. It had some outdoor pools, including 1 pool where you can play volley or hand ball in the pool. I stayed here for 2 days for a seminar. The snacks served during tea break were delicious, but I thought breakfast and lunch meal should be upgraded. it was not as good as another similar luxury hotel.But the scenery from the restaurant ( The Sand) was amazing, directly to the beach and sea. There were also some relaxing chairs where you could just sit at the beach enjoying the sea view. There were 2 big malls just within walking distance.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Sheena R;Wonderful hotel;We stayed here for one night whilst travelling around Bali. It is a beautiful and very luxurious hotel with the wow factor when you enter! The lobby, gardens, pool and rooms are all fab and everything is immaculate. The stay were also lovely. The breakfast buffet is plentiful, with something for ever taste. The only thing I would comment on is the hotel was very quiet when we visited, not many other guests, and so I'm not sure I would have wanted to stay for a longer stay with no one else around the pools restaurants etc. I put this down to it being a new hotel and I'm sure this place will become much more popular over time!;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;lionitaly;Affordable luxury in Kuta;The Anwaya is a big, new and elegant hotel lying very close to the airport and in a quiet area of Kuta beach. It has the advantage to offer you for an affordable price an high standard and an ambiance far away from most of the lodging offer in Kuta. The luxurious Bali starts here and you can appreciate the wide and luminous rooms, the nice garden and the big swimming pool, the choice of high level restaurants and the service level very good also if not perfect. You can also use the beach facilities in front of the structure and in conclusion, also if Kuta is not definitely the best location where to stay in Bali if you are searching a sophisticated and quiet ambiance, the Anwaya is a good oasis and definitely considering the ratio quality price is a perfect choice also for a hotel in Bali.;4;1;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Sagar M;V.good property to stay in kuta;It's a v.good location in Kuta despite being so close to the airport. It took us just 30000 IDR (2.5 us dollars) from the hotel to airport by Blu bird taxi. This property has a v.good beach with lots of sunbeds and a walking track along the beach shore which leads to the lots of good restaurants and discovery mall. The front road is the main tourist road again full of restaurants, shopping, pharmacy and mini marts. But once inside the resort, it is quite and away from the outside disturbance. It is v.easy to find a taxi on this road but by evening the traffic tends to get jammed. We stayed for 3 nights between 16-19th aug 2017 in the premier lagoon access room.

The staff is very nice and accomodating, the beds are so comfy, the bathroom amenities are the best I ever seen, the housekeeping guys are very fast and they always cleaned our room in less than 10 minutes, the pools and the beach are very nice and clean, the buffet breakfast is huge and it has everything from the international to the tipical things, salted and sweet.;5;0;0;1;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;332shivanik;breakfast;We stayed here in early august. We had booked for delux rooms, which were upgraded to premier rooms which were good, but mini-bar is not free.The weather was good, sometimes it rained. The beach at the back of hotel is nice but rocky. The location is super, within 10 min. to discovery mall and 7min. drive to kuta beach. Many restaurants nearby, even supermarkets. For wifi is good, but it disconnects everywhere and we have to connect it again. The breakfast has huge variety with vast spread, but you have to search for the things you want, the attendents are well mannered and help you also. But the breakfast is most probably same for every day. For the vegetarians and Indian food the variety was same for 5 days we stayed -veg. rice, green dal and curry, but we talked to the chef;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;NarayanaTravelling;Beautiful Hotel & Surroundings For Our Honeymoon;We booked The Anvaya Beach Resort quite last minute for our very belated Honeymoon! The hotel is located about 5-10 minutes from the airport. I actually booked a car from the hotel by emailing them in advance which was at a cost of 200,000 IDR (about £11.50) for a bit of piece of mind. However, it would have been cheaper and easy enough to just get a taxi. Our room was beautiful and very clean with pleasant decor. The tiny wardrobe located in the bathroom was very disappointing however. There was next to nowhere to hang or put away our clothes which proved a little bit difficult when you're away on a 10 day holiday! The bed was large and very comfortable which was very welcome after a long day's sight seeing! There were also universal plug sockets which was very handy.;4;0;1;0;1;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;MarieClifton;Relaxation at the Avaya Resort;My husband and I stayed at the Anvaya Resort at the beginning of July. The room was very luxurious and well appointed and we had many memorable breakfasts and drinks at The Sands Restaurant on the beach. All staff were very pleasant and most helpful. My friends and I had high tea at the Kunyit Restaurant. The High Tea was truly amazing, and the food the best I've ever experienced. The staff were most attentive and the restaurant ambience was so relaxing. I would recommend going to the Kunyit Restaurant for High Tea and will be definitely returning during my next holiday in Bali. Many thanks to Sri Wahyuningsih for making this such a memorable afternoon at the Anvaya.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Sofie H;Awesome stay 👍👍;We stayed at this hotel for 12 nights. The first 3 nights we had the premier room with direct access to the lagoon pool. Very nice room. The room is quite big with complete amenities. When we first arrived at 15.00 pm, the receptionist told us that the room was not ready yet and we needed to wait. We were not amused since the check in time should actually already at 14.00 pm. But the operation manager solved this immediately. The rest 9 nights we stayed at the first floor with nice view over the pool. There is 1 pool for playing volley ball. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. The hotel offers free yoga classes on Monday and Friday on 7.00 am. The breakfast was at the ‘Sand’ which offers beach front view. The variety of the breakfast is huge. Indonesian delicacies, Indian;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Julia L;Great hotel.;We stayed for 3 nights, the hotel is beautifully designed. However the service is rather slow. Ordering drink by the pool (coconut), lunch at Kunyit and room service were all too long for waiting time. We had accident however, my husband fell in to the corner of pool lobby (near the entrance) at night time as there was no enough lighting around that particular spot. 4 star for the hotel and its facilities but needs improvement for the food service and the pool lobby.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Sara B;5 star Bali;This review is well overdue. I stayed at The Anvaya in May and had the most beautiful week in Bali. This is by far the best hotel I have stayed in Bali. From the moment I arrived I was treated like royalty, my room was upgraded to a pool access room for free and when I was escorted to my room there was a little tray of gourmet cakes waiting for me. This apparently was a nightly service. Every night around 7pm staff would deliver a range of little deserts that were absolutely delicious (restaurant quality). The bed was huge and very comfortable. I found the room to be a good size. All hotel facilities are accessible via the TV including ordering room service. The Kunyit restaurant is a five star dining experience. Upon arrival you are served a traditional Indonesian welcome;5;0;0;1;1;0;1

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Samuel Pasaribu;Perfect stay at Kuta;I stayed here for 3 days for business meeting. I arrived late and had a quick check in. At that moment there was not available room boy and the front office staff her self guide me to my room. The hotel was very big and it is not easy to find the room at the first time. The room was clean and comfort. There was small swimming pool near my room and there was another big one near the beach. The breakfast was also nice with complete menu and delicious taste. I also took dinner at the restaurant near the beach. There was live music and the sunset was really amazing there. In the morning I took a walk on the track along the beach. It was around 2 KM and passed some other hotels. The beach also clean and good to swim. My stay was really perfect.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Karl K;Couldn't have been much better!;We stayed four nights as part of our honeymoon. It was hands down the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at. The attention to detail was unreal. The rooms were very nice and had everything we needed in them. It's a very large place in terms of number of rooms but you would never know it while staying there. The hotel, lobby, even the pool never felt anywhere close to crowded. It's located on the south end of Kuta which is nice because the beaches are not littered with locals trying to sell you things. You will encounter some but nothing compared to the areas north of here as we found out. We rented bikes from the resort and rode the Seminyak one day was was nice. There is a concrete path along the beach that runs several miles north.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Pragati O;Friendly people, great service, fantastic rooms!;We stayed @ The Anvaya Villa for 9 days with two kids - a ten year old and a 6 month old baby. Since we were travelling with an infant, we tried almost all the services that Anyava resort had - travel desk, butler service, in-room dining, child care, restaurants, pool and spa. The villa was beautiful and had a huge pool. Both the villa and the pool were well maintained. Both restaurants - Kuniyat and Sands - were nice with a big breakfast buffet. The staff is friendly and eager to please. They went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. Dewi, Andy and our personal butler - Rafael - provided personalized service. Rafael understood our tastes and suggested sight seeing and restaurants that were to our liking.;5;0;0;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Priyank Aggarwal;Anvaya Resort, Kuta, Bali;Dear All, Me and my wife stayed at Anvaya Resort for 4 nights, during our visit to Bali between 3rd July to 7th July 2017. Staying there was a pleasant experience overall. Located in the heart of Kuta with many interning eating, pubs & shopping experience just as you step out of the resort. Housekeeping is excellent, overall ambience is very good & well maintained, as expected by any good resort. Staff is very courteous and helpful. They are always ready to help and assist very politely and with a pleasant smile. Food is good, specially the masala tea and dosa at the breakfast was too good. The only improvement I recommend is on room service front. It takes a long time for them to serve food in the rooms. Rest everything is perfect. Regards, Priyank Aggarwal;4;0;1;1;0;0;0

Stayed on 2511 end of June. It was quite full as it was national holiday period. Pool was clean, facilities were in good standard. Room was great. Kids club was fun. Need improvements on: - Check-in / Check-out Desks: there were 5/6 available but only 3 used. Which makes us queue for quite a long time. - Beach was not as expected, it was dirty, should have people clean it every day. - Flower vase in bathroom was never cleaned and it smells really bad. Did mention it to housekeeping but they didn't bother to change it (maybe because it was really smelly). - Room door closer need fixing / change as it didn't shut the door properly.

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;ksw-notes;Newly renovated in quarter end of 2016 from Santika hotel;"Located in prime Kuta area at Kartika Plaza street, this former Santika Hotel has a total face off becoming Anvaya beach resort hotel. One of the latest five stars hotels in Kuta and offers nice sandy beach and about 3-4 medium 1.2m swimming pools enough also provided kids pool. The room is fancy but the mirror wall in shower looks dirty with dusty dirt unable to get out from the wall. The luggage holder is in the bathroom which is a bit inconvenience to open just next to the toilet seat. Amenities and beds are great. Wall TV 40"" is very satisfying. The breakfast area looking at the beach is awesome view in the morning. The food selection is plenty from Indonesian, Oriental, Indian, Japanese, and Western food. It's a 5* from me.";4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;DubaiMall1234;Beautiful new boutique hotel;Stunning new boutique hotel at Tuban beach. The rooms are lovely and fully equipped, staff is wonderful and could not be more helpful. The only slight downside are the F&B, the breakfast is made for Asian clientele with few Western options and little choice for vegetarians. The buffet is not refilled regularily which is annoying and looks like a warzone. Some dishes served at the restaurant and room service have sizes that are even too small for a child. To stay at, this hotel is great, for food and drinks better go elsewhere, the lack in the F&B area is reflected in the people attending the bars and restaurants, even when fully booked they remain pretty empty.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0

It has great rooms,look new, good safety protection, the best beach in Kuta (which is not saying much, but it is the best beach there--better beaches are in Legian and Nusa Dua and Sunur--for North Americans who are used to the amazing beaches in the Caribbean--clean, white,fine sand with crystal blue, calm waters--these are not those beaches). The hotel is about 5 min after exiting the airport and should not cost more than IRD 30,000 which is US$3.

The lagoon has the advantage that it acts as an extended private pool and you have the great view of the lawn too. We had booked two adjacent rooms for our kids and us. The room had all the comfort one would expect from a 5 star hotel and the housekeeping is par excellent.

Such rooms have no ocean view so I switched to a high floor since ocean view is important to me when I am in Bali. Management was very accommodating for my preference.";5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;123susan456;WOULDN'T CONSIDER ANY OTHER HOTEL IN KUTA;First I would like to thank the women who rescued me when I arrived for not walking right into the water lol. I arrived at night and was tired and didn't notice. I was really take back at the magnificent lobby and grounds of the AVANYA, there are water features all over the grounds including the lobby. Having a nice looking hotel is one thing but without good service it means nothing to me. I was warmly greater then escorted to the sweet warm helpful lady Ellis. Checking was so simple and because deluxe was full I was offered an upgrade. The room was immaculate as was the hotel. Good movie channels which for me is important. Although it is a large facility I felt as if it was home. The breakfast buffet was better than any I have seen with great foods for all cultures.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Namitha S;Great stay;We stayed at Anvaya Bali between 8th-13th May 2017. The resort is beautiful . The staff were extremely courteous and helpful. We were a group of three families and booked 4 rooms of which two were interconnected. The room appeared a little small but the beds were large and comfortable and could easily accommodate a family with two small children. The bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean with all amenities and toiletries. The balcony was pool facing. Buffet breakfast had an elaborate spread and was very good and catered to all tastes.;5;0;0;1;0;1;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Wizzya;Amazing!!!!;It was our first trip to Bali and we stayed at Anvaya resort for 3 night in a deluxe room. From the time we were picked up from the airport, we were treated very well and knew we chose the right hotel. Resort itself was very huge and beautiful it had 2 restaurants(traditional and modern) and 4 pools with beach access. Checkin was very easy and quick, refreshing drinks and towels were served during checkin. Good size room and bathroom with balcony and a huge king bed. Bed was super comfy. All the staffs were very helpful and friendly, everyone we met greeted us with smile. Breakfast was amazing with so many options. I still miss their breakfast. Pools were usually less crowded and all the pools had a small bar when u can get drinks and snacks. I loved the cocktails they serve.;5;0;0;1;0;0;1
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;kevin w;Great Hotel for Kuta, Bali;Stayed for six nights, and hard to find any fault with the hotel, or to put it another way, everything almost perfect. The staff are super friendly and helpful, they all take time to learn your name, and both the GM and Manager came by to chat and take feedback. Its a very modern hotel, with all the facilities you would expect. A large pool, direct access onto the beach, a great patio for evening drinks watching the sunset directly in front of you. There is a large restaurant for breakfast within a fantastic choice, super clean rooms, and so much more. It is a fifteen minute walk to the Main Kuta Beach, but a small price to pay for everything else. Thank you for a great stay.;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;m-ebrahim;Very good resort with perfect location;Pros - location is perfect, alive, close to waterbom by foot, many restaurants, many currency exchange, many massage shops around - very close to airport - big good breakfast - room is new - many swimming pools with many sunbeds - spa is good - staff are very kind and nice - lot of greenery - beach access Cons - upon check in, the bed was not clean, hair and a big stain on it as if it was not changed at all, we called room service and they changed it quickly. The incident could ruin my rating, as hygiene is something really matters, and I really wanted to give the resort 3 stars for that incident - bali beaches are not nice, if you are used to Thailand beaches or Philippines;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Raf A;Beautiful place;Stayed for 2 nights in a pool access room. It was fantastic. The pool was great and if one is bored, one can take a walk along the beach. There was a good spread for breakfast ranging from chinese to indonesian to western. They even had Japanese food. Location is also good. A short walk to the shopping mall and Kuta. Service staff was also polite. Only minor flaws: - house keeping was slow. The room was not clean when I came back in the afternoon. - best to arrive after 7am for breakfast. The staff and some food items were not ready before 7am - there are stray dogs that ventured to the lounge seats at the beach. Worried me a bit as I am afraid of stray dogs. Otherwise, it was a pleasant stay.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Notreve76;Nice place just missing Something;Just spent 4 nights here and overall a good stay. Weve been to all the 5* hotels in kuta and legian and while this one is very nice it lacks atmosphere. The staff are wonderful, Rooms very nice, pools great and breakfast fantastic. However I think its aimed more at the business/conference market. There are no special nights like themed nights or special dinner nights and to be honest it was all a bit boring. There are hundreds of loungers by the pool but on 3 of the days we were the only people at the pool all day. The lack of a swim up bar was slightly dissapointing too. So overall a nice place that could be amazing.;4;0;1;1;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Hermawan K;THE ANVAYA, Bali: Five-Star Hospitality, Indonesian Personality;That is an account of my positive experience at The Anvaya Beach Resort, Bali during my trip from May 14-18, 2017. Three main reasons for that. Location, Facility and Personality! About ten minutes away by car from Ngurah Rai Bali Airport, across from a private beach, nearby street shops, and a surrounded by a variety of exotic restaurants make it the best location in Kuta area. Normal Room, Lagoon Access Room, Anvaya Suite, Beachfront Villas and World-Class Spa, Kunyit Indonesian Restro plus big and small meeting rooms sum up the great facility and accommodation at the resort. And this one is the most important: An Indonesian personality reflected mainly from the people, the food and the atmosphere.

There are only a limited number of cocktails you can chose from but no-one tells you this. Also like many Australians we cannot sleep under the weight of a doona and when we asked for a blanket the hotel has no blankets. Surely a hotel with nearly 500 rooms could supply a blanket. Also the pools are narrow and all only 1.2m deep - and if you like a drink while swimming there is no pool bar. These aside our eight days were excellent.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;pranara;Good hotel;Stayed there for 5 nights. Started on a bad note as arrived at night to find air con not working. Was repaired at 2am in the morning. However staff were apologetic and we were moved to another room in the morning. Staff very polite and hospitable. We engaged a driver Adie for a tour and he was very good indeed. Hotel restaurant good. Also a superb Indian restaurant Ganesh at the Lippo mall next door. Rooms on the small side but clean and well stocked. Staff are very very polite. A big peeve is the airport taxi pick up rates- the hotel charged us 200,000 rupiah to pick us up for a 15 minute journey. When we took a normal Bluebird street taxi to drop us at the airport on pur return it cost us a mere 25,000 rupiah incl airport entry charges- a nearly tenfold difference!;4;0;1;1;0;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Joseph G;Slick and Chick;This place is cool. Marble hallways and grand entrance. Three large pools. Suites that step out to their own swimming area. Speakers throughout the swimming areas playing chill out tunes. It also has a clean beach area,rare in Kuta. An amazing breakfast buffet. The king size beds are big enough to sleep two adults and a kid and they are comfortable. The hotel just had it's grand opening so the place was empty, that was a plus. The location was a ten minute walk from the famous water park and a mall. The restaurant food was good but not great. It will probably get better. There were some maintenance issues that shut the toilets down and pools but I am sure that is part of being brand new.;5;0;1;0;0;1;1

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;Nuzakat;Best resort in Kuta hands down;We spent a lovely 7 nights here and were blessed to be a part of the grand opening. It has taken me some time to do this review as I was blown away by the generosity and genuine respect provided by the staff at Anvaya. Management and the team have done a great job here in keeping their staff very professional as well as very friendly. I have stayed at many 5 star resorts and all charging a lot more per night than the Anvaya and none have ever given us such respect as here. Management I congratulate you and hope you will reward your staff accordingly. If you are looking for a 5 star resort in Kuta that is centrally located and the staff are professional and friendly, then look no further. This is the place to be. PROs - the rooms a very spacious and cleaned immaculately;5;0;0;1;1;1;0

Kuta Bali;The Anvaya Beach Resort;dumbo17;Getaway;All over our experience in this hotel meet my expectation, me and my husband stayed in deluxe room facing to the swimming pool (not the main pool) , I love the lighting in the room , the dim light and the big bed make me sleep very well. The first two days we had breakfast in kunyit restaurant, I was not satisfied because I saw several flies alighted on food , third day we tried the restaurant facing to the beach, we pay a little extra charge which was better. Breakfast has so many variety, the local food taste good, but for international breakfast if you are a foodie I won't recommend. We hope in the future they keep their standard since this hotel is very new, grand opening 2016 Nov. we will consider this hotel for our next trip. Thanks The Anvaya;4;0;0;0;0;0;1

Back in September we were staying at a nearbye rival and decided to take a walk to see how progress on the rebuild was going. To our delight there were limited rooms on offer on walk up basis as part of the ""Soft Opening "" period as the finishing touches were being completed. Needless to say we cancelled our last three nights at the rival Hotel and checked into our brand new pool access suite at the new Anvaya. It is really so lovely and still has the old Santika Vibe about it but has improved out of this world. There are about 40 of the old Santika faces still at the Hotel who recognised my";5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Ubud Bali;Adiwana Bisma Ubud;Carly G;The best hotel I’ve ever been to!;It was not on a busy street but was basically in the center of the island in Ubud. So it was easy to get around to popular tourist destinations. The hotel was beautiful and surrounded by plants which gave us the full island experience. The infinity pool and poolside bar overlooked a valley of trees and plants which was just so surreal. In terms of the room itself, the bed was very comfortable and the pillows were heaven.

Ubud Bali;Adiwana Bisma Ubud;Charles G;Adiwana Bisma - beautiful hotel;Fantastic hotel! Included excellent all day breakfast as well as afternoon tea. Room was beautiful with a great shower. The pool on the roof looking over the jungle is incredible! We did choose to do the floating breakfast in the pool. Perhaps we were naive but we had expected the pool would be closed and this would be a private breakfast, however there were several other guests at the pool including a couple doing a photo shoot right behind where we had the floating breakfast. That obviously made it aess romantic experience. That's the only negative thing I have to say about the hotel which was fantastic in every other way;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Cassandra C;Relaxing stay at Maya Sanur;Decided to stay at Maya Sanur for the first time as we wanted to stay somewhere less crowded than the usual Bali haunts. It was a great decision - Maya Sanur offers many activities for guests to do such as yoga, picnics, afternoon tea and more. We really got more than we expected :) Rooms are very modern and clean. It was also very spacious, which gives off a real luxurious feeling. One thing to note though, the long pool that you see in the photos is actually a private pool meant for those in the pool suite. The actual public pool is rather small but still enjoyable. I highly…;5;1;0;0;1;1;0

I was tempted to book a private pool villa but as other reviewers pointed out many lack direct sun and privacy. I booked a pool access suite and although a lovely sized space it has no privacy because the board walk path in front of the pool is not blocked off so most guests who are unaware this is private space or just don't care walk on it instead of the secondary pathway.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0

After traveling for 27hrs to Bali from NYC I had some high expectations for my holiday. I am writing this review because my expectations were exceeded by Maya Resorts in Sanur and Ubud. I stayed in a wonderful garden view room from June 20-27th. The garden view rooms were cleaned to perfection, comfortable, and stocked well to meet a traveler’s every need. A pool sits right outside the garden villas for a dip without having to go to the main pool. The grounds were always pristine and the tree bar and main pool were conveniently located right next to the boardwalk and beach so there are options to choose from. The spa and gym area is located within a short walking…;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Skeldalehouse;I'd come bak tomorrow if I could;We spent a wonderfull five nights in this modern hotel, right on a very quiet small beach. Wake to a great sunrise with views on the volcano and still reflective waters. This is not a surf beach, as there is a reef about 500 meters offshore that ensures the waters on the beach are always comfortable, with no tidal rips or big waves. A great beach for early morning or late evening photography. The rooms are modern, clean and extremely comfortable with plenty of space. Bathrooms are modern, clean and have all facilities, include a large modern bath for those who wish to soak. Nightly cocktails are available at the tree bar, where you can relax, catch the last rays of sunshine, and enjoy great views. There is a great swimming pool, breakfast is varied and caters for all tastes.…;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

My room, the facilities and grounds were all modern and kept spotlessly clean while still having a nice tropical feel. The location is perfect, one end right on the beach and the other right on the main street. In terms of some constructive feedback, the bath towels were a bit thin and they could implement the use of ""Do Not Disturb/Please Make Up My Room"" door cards rather than ringing the room bell to see if you're there.

The rooms are not very spacious, but beautiful, warm, and comfortable. What I like most is the elongated and very clean swimming pool. Lazing on the balcony sofa by the pool is very pleasant. The quality of the pool water is good, not salty. There are indeed dry leaves that fall into the pool, but that's the result of falling from the trees by the pool. The bathroom is also very nice. The hot water consistency is very good. The quality of the hotel rooms and building materials is very good because this hotel is still relatively new. Lots of greenery around the hotel rooms.

Make sure either stay at first the floor with pool access, or above it with the special Cabana for you to lounge.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;WeTrippinAU;Pure bliss;We have just spent 5 nights at the Maya Sanur Resort and it has been amazing. The rooms are by far one of the nicest places we have stayed in. We chose the lagoon access room so we could swim without being in a pool with kids. It was definitely worth the extra money. There are walls in the lagoon approx every 3-5 rooms so you don’t get people swimming past your room at all. The bathroom is divine, we loved the double sinks and the very large bath tub, which I used multiple times.;5;1;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Shelley M;Swanky hotel on right on the beach;Overall the hotel was lovely. Very new and clean, spacious, well appointed rooms. The day bed was great. My 7 yr old son slept on it comfortably. We didn't use the Lagoon Pool as we didn't have a Lagoon Access Pool and you felt really intrusive to those that did. So we had to go down 3 floors and walk a fair way to the main pool every day with two kids. Not ideal. My husband ordered the Eggs Benedict for breakfast which unfortunately gave his food poisoning. This really impacted our holiday.;5;0;1;0;1;1;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;D S;Very relaxing stay;We had a room with lagoon access, close to the spa, fitness, pool and restaurant, which we thouroughly enjoyed. Spacious room and bathroom with all the amenities you need. Great art above the bed. Big round bathtub, which is a lot of fun. A lovely view of the ocean from the pool/bar area - the hotel is right by the beach and the board(side)walk, which will lead you to other parts of Sanur.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Ulrica K;Really nice hotell well located;We visited Maya Sanur with the family of five, the youngest child being 12. We stayed for 6 nights. We really appreciated the location of the hotel, it was in between the two more ”busy” parts of the Sanur Beach which made it easy for us to choose direction when wanting to eat or rent a SUP for example. The hotel was very clean and the rooms was nicely designed. Comfortable beds and good bathroom. We stayed in a room with direct access to the small lagoon. The hotel has many rooms, but the hotel Itself is not very big. Mainly the pool and the restaurants. The garden therefore remind me more of a boutique hotel.;4;0;1;0;1;1;1

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Diena A;The Best Honeymoon Ever;My husband surprised me with a short escape to Bali for what we called for our honeymoon. Close to many restaurants, boutiques, and art market. We can rent bicycles to explore Sanur and it areas. The ambience of the room is so great plus zen music played and hypnotizing us.... Every single side of room is very functional. My husband and I enjoyed the balcony and spent most of our stay in the hotel.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Linda P;Lovely;We always stay in a lagoon access room, which is great to. E able to step straight into the lagoon pool from the sundeck.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;julz;Relaxing stay;The reception area is very clinical & resembles an office area. I really was worried what I'd booked. The room however was very nice . I will add that the 2 double beds are much smaller than i'd thought...however for a short stay it was fine for 3 people (couple & son) together. Its not designed for kids as the outdoor areas are quite limited.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;KPHM;An oasis of luxurious calm in an idyllic location;We stayed for five nights in December 2019 and had an absolutely wonderful experience. Happy hour cocktails at the Tree Bar were delightful and the swimming pool was never crowded. If you can, do book a lagoon access room. Being able to take a peaceful early morning, and late night dip is priceless. The location is right in the middle of the stretch of Sanur Beach and we were spoilt for choice with dining options outside of the hotel.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Mona S;Lovely hotel;We stayed at the Maya Sanur for 6 nights (also at two other places). The hotel is perfectly situated in Sanur, on the beach, near shops, spas, restaurants etc. Our room was very big and beautifully designed with direct access to the swimming pool (smaller one) The bathroom has double sinks with a big shower and separate bathtub. Everything was clean and well maintained. The hotel has a very nice atmosphere and beautiful architecture. Highlights were morning yoga and romantic private dinner in the rooftop garden with a ocean view and live music. Best dining experience ever.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Hotel is well built, so anything is close - main pool, to spa, to bar, to gym and to your room.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Mehmet G;Amazing;Really nice hotel. the rooms are top and very clean. We did not see any reptiles in the room as there are otherwise plenty of them in bali. The hotel and also pool area is really nice and we can highly recommend this hotel.;5;0;0;0;0;1;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;JasonSyd1;Lovely stay;"My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights in a Lagoon Access Room. The rooms are just beautiful, very spacious, clean and modern; we were impressed. The lagoon access was also a treat, and very relaxing. Breakfast was substantial and delicious. Barista made Coffee very good. The Tree Bar happy hour was great, and the food on offer great too. I had to take a star off the review for a couple of reasons. First, the hotel is extremely modern and clean, lots of concrete, lovely manicured gardens etc however we felt this was at the expense of any personality. The hotel has a bit of a cold, sterile feel. They could improve this but adding a few more personal and cultural touches; some Balinese music in the foyer, more traditional decor etc. While the Tree Bar was good for happy…";4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;elrobsono83;Great place for some relax;Rooms are big and ust beautiful. We got a lagoon access room and it was very nice, way calmer than we expected. The place is super clean There are many nice restaurants and shops around. The night market is also a 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The beach in front is super nice. You can have a swim in the morning, during high tide and continue to relax on the pool or stay at the beach if you prefer. Try to get this breakfast refunded or use ti up on the first day. Boiled egg, croissant and a juice - that's what you'll get.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;AliciaCecilia;Quiet holidays;Maya Sanur is a modern hotel / small resort . A few steps to the beach . We booked a suite with swimming pool in the balcony and asked them to have second floor snd sunny side , the ones on ground floor are under the swimming pools of the second floor ones as a kind of roof , then have shade all the time , while the gardens receive sun . The ones on second floor have just a balcony with lounges and nicer view . We like the modern room and big bathroom with the round and also big Bathtub, like specially the window behind our bed with hanging plants and the little gifts they provided . The tree bar great , good music .;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Imfundu;Simply Remarkable;Loved absolutely every single thing about this Hotel at Sanur. Stayed with a friend in lagoon view room and we were both impressed with the room. Great location on a very clean beach with a plethora of restaurants a 5 minute walk along the beach. Tree Bar had a great atmosphere as well. Great wifi, breakfast, pool area, rooftop garden not to be missed. Had a massage across the road where there are a few shops. All the in-house restaurants looked busy with delicious sounding menus. Do yourself a favour and stay at this remarkable property.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;DCMIT1;Relaxing Stay, Impeccable Service, Dining Didn't Quite Hit The Spot!;"My wife, daughter and I arrived around 13pm having travelled from Ubud. Although normal check- out is 12pm we were able to access our two Lagoon Access Rooms without delay. We were originally booked in rooms 106 and 108 however 106 appeared very shaded given its proximity to the hotel lobby areas, which extends to three floors and blocks the sun as it rises in the afternoon. Having already unpacked, we decided after 30 mins that 106 wasn't to our liking due its position and ask Reception to move us. This was no trouble at all; in fact, Reception couldn't have assisted us any more than they did, taking us to three alternative rooms so we could check them out, eventually settling on room 114. The Lagoon Access Rooms are set along a picturesque tree-lined pathway and although none…";4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;SJC;Perfect Hotel;We stayed at this hotel for 10 nights and everything was absolutely faultless. cleanliness and food was perfect. The resort itself is well spread out so even though the hotel was full, it didn't seem overly crowded or busy. There was always spare sun loungers around the pool and although breakfast was busy, there was always plenty of food and service was still great. The hotel is well situated on a quiet part of the beach at one end and the middle of the main road in sanur at the other. We had both the buffet breakfast in Reef (I think it was open from 6.30 until 10) and the a la carte breakfast in Graze (10.30 until 3pm!) and both were great although we favoured the non-buffet option in graze. We stayed in a lagoon access room which was spacious;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Melissa H;5 star service;We travel internationally 4-5 times per year. I have never felt so welcomed and unobtrusively catered to. The rooms are thoughtfully designed and comfortable. Food and drinks were tasty and not too expensive. We stayed 8 nights and did not want to go home. I would book the lagoon room next time though 3rd floor was lovely too.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;gmb27;4 star, certainly not 5;My wife and I stayed here for 8 days...best feature is the location! Very central in Sanur and on the beach. Whilst the room was comfortable, spacious and clean it was located at the street end of the complex meaning to use the fitness centre, the pool, the dining area, the Tree Bar and to access the beach there was quite a long walk. Just be aware to ask for a room perhaps in the middle of the complex and don't forget to ask for a room that is not connected to the room next door as you can score some noisy neighbours! The Tree Bar offered Happy Hour from 5-7 each evening which was terrific (great value) but they were either understaffed or working to an inefficient system as it was a long time between drinks!;4;1;1;0;1;1;0

The room was large enough to accommodate us, and the access to the pool was great (a new experience). The bathroom amenities were plentiful and included all what you may think of, and they was plentiful of bottled drinking water and they would refill every time (they were very generous)! Their room service was 7 star!! During our stay we were offered a complimentary family photo. There was a photographer who took many photo of us, and offered us 1 free photo.

Everything was perfect for us and I cannot hesitate to recommend your hotel to people who are visiting Bali. Service, room, food, pool, spa were all excellent. Really liked the idea that this was a ""small"" hotel where you are treated as a valued guest, compared to many larger hotels in Bali where you are treated as just being a number. All staff were excellent and professional but special praise must go to Leili on reception who arranged trips for us and went above and beyond. My partner did not want to leave!

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;veraison;Funky design, great pool, central Sanur;The Maya is an unusual design, being on a long, narrow piece of land with beach access. This has obviously informed the design, which is long and narrow, with very little 'garden' space. There are four floors of rooms with the rooms at ground level having access to there own terrace and direct access to a long narrow pool. I'm not sure how much privacy these rooms would have as there is a main walkway from front to back of the hotel. With the reception and street access at the front and larger pool, beach, restaurant and bar at the back, it's a long walk past all these rooms. On floors 2,3 & 4 rooms have a balcony, which is quite nice and more private. Interestingly the long narrow design has a sloped roof from the beach to the highest point, where there is a roof…;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Beach walk is fabulous, very clean and quiet, over all 10/10,, will be back!;5;1;1;0;0;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Aeroboffin;Good hotel and staff. Excellent Spa. Not a beach resort.;Our flight arrived after midnight so the trip to the hotel from the airport was about 20 minutes with no traffic. In the daytime, it would be a different story!! The main part of the hotel is a long thin building which runs from the main street to the beach. Our room was on the ground floor with access to one of the long pools which ran the length of the main building. The room and bathroom were very spacious. My only complaint was that there was not many places (drawers) to store clothes. As were were there for 8 nights we would have preferred to unpack our suitcases. Lighting, AC and Wi-Fi were excellent. In addition to the long thin pools, there is also a regular pool next to the tree bar (very pleasant).;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;delirant;Would return;This place is amazing value. It’s design is Japanese influenced and really artistic. The rooms are well appointed and quite luxurious. The pool is beautiful and there’s a bar right on the beach if you just want to sit and take in the view. We paid a little extra and had a room that had lagoon access - worth it for a quick dip anytime. The location is good and I have to say I was so impressed I’d definitely return. First time to Sanur and I wish we had stayed longer. Quite a classy establishment;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Susan K;Very Relaxing;Top hotel, we had Lagoon access room, breath taking room, very sofisicated, beautiful balcony & day bed, bed & pillow not so comfy, the step down to the pool is to low very hard to get in & out, breakfast was fabulous, bar over looking the beach you just could sit there all day drinking finding nemos which is the best cocktail;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Paul L;Relaxing and well appointed resort;We stayed at the Maya for 5 nights as part of our honeymoon, and loved it. Being beachfront, we were able to swim in the sea each day, as well as relax around the pool. There is a great selection of restaurants to choose from, as well as room service. The place has a sense of calmness about it, which made it a nice retreat from the normal bali vibe - it's not a party place. We'd definitely stay again.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Jane H;Perfect Bali getaway;5 nights at the Maya could easily become 10! What a fabulous resort with warm, welcoming and attentive staff! We had a lagoon room which was perfectly located in the resort near the yoga studio, gym, restaurant and bar and the beach pathway to all the close by restaurants, although we ate at the Maya most evenings as they had great specials and events and the quality of the food was excellent. The restaurant staff were just so lovely. The room had everything we needed, as well as pool access! I loved that! I couldn’t fault our stay at the Maya and can’t wait to go back.;5;0;1;1;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;paulsMidlands;Beautiful resort;We have just returned from the Maya and had a lovely time. The staff were very friendly, helpful and so hardworking. A la carte breakfast at Graze was very good particularly if like us you aren't a fan of buffets! The room was lovely but it was a lagoon view room on the 2nd floor and we found it very difficult to sleep due to the very noisy Chinese guests who were partying until 3am each morning in the lagoon, we tried ear plugs but could still hear them! Because of this we probably wouldn't return. Don't miss watching the sunset at the tree bar with half price cocktails;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;oberunrun;Exceptional!;I am very impressed with this hotel. I love the room as they very clean, big and comfortable. Bathroom was outstanding. The property sits on a perfect spot on the beachstrip of Sanur. Its ideal for walk among the beach. Main pool has a great view to the beach. Although the breakfast is too average for a luxurious hotel.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;ernest024;the best way to enjoy your stay in Sanur;Being here again after 2 years for 5 weeks again, we highly appreciate the very high standart of the room and all facilities including the Lagoon aerea.

As yearly visitors be will choose the Maya Hotel for sure again;5;1;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Ferke9;Wonderful hotel;We stayed for a week in a lagoon access room. And it was worth every penny. The swimming pool is right next to the room door, it is just a blast to wake up and basically roll your way into the water. The rooms were large, beautiful and the bathrooms were just great. Despite the tropical environment, they seem to do their best to eradicate mosquitos, since they did not really bother us. The hotel is on the beach, however we did not really go there, since the water was not really clean. If you are looking for Caribbean waters, Sanur will disappoint you. The hotel however does have a nice little swimming pool with views of the Ocean. There are a few restaurants, the Japanese one is actually very good, otherwise nothing really impressive.;5;1;0;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Polly1308;Beautiful addition to Sanur;The Maya is a beautiful tranquil slice of paradise in the heart of Sanur. The rooms stunning and the location fantastic. The pool overlooks the beach and is a great place to watch the world go by. The breakfast was plentiful and offered lots of choice. The room was well appointed and comfortable. I often find beds in Bali hard but this was comfortable. The only downside was the room felt warm at times ( despite the aircon staying on 22 degrees). My only complaint was having to leave. It’s a lovely hotel .;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

All rooms have verandahs with ""lounger bed"". 1st floor rooms walk out to swimming canal. At the end of the canal is the largest pool and beach access. This is also where the bar is located. Good happy hour but get there early as all three levels get busy for sunset. Lovely spa, good Wi-Fi, lots of loungers pool side, specials thorough out the day (i.e. 2 drinks and free pizza).

The bathroom was huge with two sinks, a large soaking tub, walk-in shower, and toilet enclosure; separated from the bedroom by a glass wall! Our balcony on the fourth floor looked down over a forest and lagoon swimming pool on the ground level. The breakfast buffets were huge and had a number of delicious offerings.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Zoe W;Couldn’t ask for more;Maya Sanur was the last stop on our recent holiday and we definitely saved the best for last. We stayed in a deluxe lagoon access room which was amazing, from the Olympic sized bathtub (I’d recommend having a frangipani bath, with perfectly placed flowers and rose petals), incredible shower, pillow menu, huge bed and sun lounger on the balcony it exceeded our expectations. I took advantage of the free daily yoga sessions which were a great way to start the day.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Room have everything you could require and more, like a fitted international plug, USB ports etc etc. Very well lit and with numerous gadget to enhance the luxurious feel like the bed had a little secluded garden at the back with electric shutter. Truly exquisite venue at all levels. The bar offers many delightful cocktails with few delicious creations of their own. The breakfast outstanding with so much choice, I gained weight just looking at it, a gustative delight. The hotel is by the beach, yet another added convenience, very well equipped gym and amazing spa with extremely good prices.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Meander824403;Memorable holiday we will never forget;It was our first time in Bali and we decided to pick a fancy hotel. Maya sanur didn’t disappoint us in any way. The rooms are great but what’s better than the rooms is the personnel and the service they offer. They are all so nice and they always strive toward making you happy. Just to name one example: we were in the rice fields and my boyfriend totally got his shoes filthy. Usually maya sanur doesn’t offer laundry service for shoes but they made an exception and the shoes came back cleaner than ever before. They make lots of efforts to see the costumer happy and that’s what we appreciated the most! Also the food was great! We went to Graze everyday where you can get a la carte breakfast instead of the buffet, we loved it! Also the tree bar and reef were great restaurants! The…;5;;;;;;
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;shirodan;Cooking class on Rooftop Terrace was the best food experience we've ever had;5 stars to the architecture (we come from architecture background) - We booked the Beachfront Pool Suite because we are a fan of private pools, and whilst Bali has no shortgage of pool villas, it is rare to have a private pool facing an open view (instead of a wall). One major issue is that this hotel sells 8 Pool Suites, but only 4 such Pool Suites are remotely worth staying in (the ones on the second floor are what we expected, and these rooms are world-class - highly recommend!). We were originally put in a Pool Suite on the ground floor which received zero sun, was directly accessible to the public.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

It was just perfect, from the gowns, slippers, bathroom, balcony and day bed to the comfort of the bed and pillows. The concierge showed us how everything worked and where to go in the morning for breakfast. After an amazing sleep, we wandered down to the Reef restaurant for what can only be described as one of the most varied and delicious buffet breakfasts. A great way to start the day. One really great thing is that if you are too late for the buffet or going on an early morning trip, you can have a late breakfast at the Graze restaurant at the front of the…;5;0;0;0;0;1;1

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Debbie O;Marvellous Maya in Sanur;After battling the crowds and noise in Legian,it was a welcome change to stay in Sanur. Maya resort is everything that encompasses a relaxing, luxury resort in all aspects.We stayed in a deluxe lagoon access room, which had a large 2 person bath ( have a rose and Frangipani bath-- $20Aus- worth it ), luxury fittings and an outside covered cabana. However, stay in a room number 130 or above, as our room was close to the Reef restaurant so on occasions it was quite noisy. We are at each of the 3 resort restaurants and throughly enjoyed each one.;5;1;1;0;0;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Richard D;Very good;We had 3 nights at Maya, staying in a lagoon view room. The room was beautifully laid out, with a big glass wall between bathroom and bedroom. Balcony was ok. The included breakfast was exactly as you would expect and could not be faulted. The only downside for us was the size of pool and ultimately the lack of space to sit around it. We are not pool dwellers at all, but despite the hotel being nowhere near capacity, we couldn’t get a space after 10am. It seems like a real flaw. Still, very much enjoyed our stay.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Daniel Iskandar S;Surprisingly beyond expectations;I booked a room in Maya Sanur last August.

It’s a lovely hotel in a great location on the beach and easily walkable to lots of great bars and restaurants. Rooms are fantastic with huge bathrooms and balconies. Everything was excellent value and the happy hour was great. Pool was lovely - only watch out is they don’t have lots and lots of sun beds and the pool can get quite shady.;4;1;1;0;1;0;0

On arrival they upgraded us to a lagoon view pool. The hotel and rooms are stunning - very modern it does make me wonder if this hotel is owned by overseas company?

Amazing room (we had one right along the pool), beautiful restaurants, bars and pool area, lovely grounds. Food was fantastic, cocktails at the Treetop Bar were great with wonderful views of the water and often live music. Our room was massive with a huge bathroom and gorgeous furniture and amenities. It is right on the beach, and there is a boardwalk all along it that takes you to shops and restaurants so the hotel is well located to get around by walking. If you are into swimming, this isn't the best spot. With the tides the water is usually quite shallow and full of sea grass. That was our only disappointment really, and not something the hotel could control. As a result, no one lied out on…;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Absolute luxury, they overlook the pool and then the beach. We used the free bikes and rode along the beach boardwalk. Only tip I have is if you stay in the lagoon access you will have people walking by your room but on the second level the greenery has grown and you have privacy on your balcony.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;ScubaStar;BEST HOTEL IN BALI;I have stayed at numerous hotels in the Bali over the past 6 years, this hotel is simply the best. I stayed in a normal room, and the suites with private pool. I was happy to upgrade to the suites because I wanted the private pool. Ask for a second-floor suite, so you can tan in the sun! You get a resort feeling, and can simply go outside, and within seconds be on the main road in Sanur. Restaurants, shopping, massage, reflex and more, just a few steps from the entrance. You can not go wrong. I really don't think other hotels in the area can beat this one. This is now forever my go-to hotel in Bali!;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Even with 2 kids tagging along, the room never felt cramped. The bathroom was big with a standing bathtub and 2 sinks, again, great for a family stay.

Our room were upgraded when we check in, from garden view to lagoon view. The room was super amazing, spacious and very neat. The view from the room also super tranquil. The bathroom also spacious and luxurious. The scent of the shower amenities also really nice. If you kinda healthy food person, you choose the right hotel.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Vivek R;Great Resort in a wonderful location;My family and I had a great stay at Maya Sanur. The resort is set in a great location in Sanur along a quieter stretch of the beach and close to restaurants, shops and Salons, and Hardys supermarket which was very helpful for us to buy groceries. The rooms were big and very clean with a very large bathroom, we found the accomodation very comfortable.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;MPet06;Beautiful Resort;We recently stayed at Maya Sanur for 4 nights and loved every minute of it! We stayed in a Pool access room and it was beautiful! Large room, big bathroom and a very comfortable bed. The main pool is gorgeous overlooking the beach and very relaxing to lie and read and book. We booked a massage and facial at the Spa and it was one of the best we have ever had, so relaxing! The breakfast is great and dinner at Reef restaurant the one night was lovely. The Treebar is also great to sit and have a relaxing drink in the evenings whilst listening to live music. We will definetely be returning.;5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Cathy L;Beautiful hotel and great spa;Maya Sanur is beautiful hotel locates in the north part of Sanur area.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Wendy F;Gorgeous resort;Rooms are super! Breakfast was awesome, best experience at graze (front). View, pools, lagoon, whole architecture and balance of building, and garden with private pools, in tree bar. Not really a beach experience however is not needed with the beds so close to the beach. Quality of food of reef restaurant is so so, not5*. Japanese was good, graze as well. Pricing of all was above average but okwith promo offerings at pool.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;andydufreyne;The most luxurious hotel in Sanur;Great hotel. Never used its SPA, it takes just 5 minutes walk from the hotel to get a nice balinese 1h massage for just 10% of the price. Same for food, took only breakfast there, which was great. But who would want to pay european prices for a dinner in Bali? Anyway, this hotel will give you a nice stay. One more thing: i had a bad smell of mold in the room.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;AdventureMom16;Beautiful Maya;"A local tour guide Wayan Suka recommended Maya Sanur and it did not disappoint me. The property is located on beach front where you can see sunrise everyday. It's peace and quiet unlike Semiyak and Ubud. I enjoyed their breakfast buffet which offers many options and it's absolutely delicious. I had a lagoon access room which offers direct access to a long pool. Although it;s not private, it's better than walking down the stairs to lay on the big pool. I stayed there for 3 nights and I was the only person using the pool.";5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Rikachuuu;Business Trip;I spent 2 nights here on my recent business trip, the room is awesome, very spacious with private balcony and modern bathroom. The private beach is clean and not crowded. The only thing that need to be improved is the food quality. I get 2x breakfast, 1x lunch at Reef and 1x dinner at Graze. All of the food taste bland and they need to improve the food varieties too.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;PascaleWB7;Definitely coming back!;We have stayed in this hotel for two and a halve weeks last year September/October. Everything in this hotel is well organised. The service was on point, the staff was so friendly, the rooms were perfect including the cleaning and the bar + restaurants were great at this place. Special thanks to Debean from the Tree Bar who really made us feel welcome and home away from home. You are a guy with a great heart, please keep on doing what you are doing. I did not write down the name of the lady from Guest Relations, but she did an amazing job to help us planning our 3-day trip to the Gili Islands.

We are regular visitors to Bali and stay at least 3 times per year and have been going to Bali for over 30 years . The rooms are very modern and spacious ,beds are super comfy and pillow menu is available to ensure a good nights sleep. Best part is the pool area which is spacious enough to avoid laying on top of other guests and ensure relaxation.some parts are shady and others sunny and the pool temp is usually cooler than other hotels we have experience which is great when the sun is shining. View over beachfront and towards Lembongan Island is beautiful…;5;0;0;0;1;0;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Kimberly P;Fantastic location;I recently stayed for 4 nights at the Maya Sanur Resort and Spa as I joined friends who were holidaying there. On arrival the greeting was a warm one and I was upgraded to a room closer to my friends. The room was large on the 4th floor modern, very clean and had everything you could want. Beautiful bath, separate shower & toilet, very comfortable bed and pillows and large day bed on balcony. Breakfast was vast and very tasty and coffee was good. The pool was lovely and cool, plenty of chairs around the pool and the bar staff provided iced cold water when ever we asked.;5;0;0;0;1;1;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Babynole80;Beautiful resort;Stayed here after Christmas and has a lovely stay. The location is right on the beach with beautiful views of the ocean from the poor and tree bar. You can also easily walk to serval shops and restaurants. We booked a suite, which had its own private infinity pool. It was delightful. The room was great with a huge round tub and separate shower. We ate dinner at the Reef Restaurant and watched the fire dance on Wednesday night. It was excellent. Do consider this resort if you are staying in Sanur.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;King Louis S;Spending Christmas together.;I’m finding it very hard to write a review about this resort because it would sound so good I’m afraid you wouldn’t believe it. But, I’ll try. This place is fantastic. If you’re in Sanur in Bali, consider staying here. Clean and spacious very green and connected to nature. The Kuu Japanese restaurant is highly recommended. Nearby shops when you want a change of environment or wander along the beachside boardwalk. Our room was huge with full bath and separate shower. Endless supply of bottled drinking water included;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Christian G;Best hotel in Sanur;This was my first time in Bali and I️ must say our stay at Maya was more than perfect! Our hotel room had a beautiful view of the beach. Lavish amenities and very spacious rooms. The breakfast is amazing overlooking pool and beach area either best western and Asian cuisine. They also have free bikes to use to go around the town and beach. I️ would definitely recommend to all that want a quiet and lavish beach time in Sanur;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Judith C;Best hotel in Sanur;I stayed here on my arrival from the USA and it was excellent for getting rid of jet lag in a safe, well kept resort. I also returned after a month of Diving in Alor to rest and relax. The rooms are well maintained and modern. The food is reasonable and excellent. The spa is excellent, I recommend Suci as a massage therapist, she is the best! I will return to Maya on my next visit to Sanur. Highly recommend this resort.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;RachelNT;Where am I?;It was a unique experience. Arrival was a totally unexpected surprise. Directed to walk up a grey concrete corridor - Lost in Space experience - then turn 90 degrees past the amusement arcade style furniture to the wall at the end - reception. Very modern spacious lagoon room - quality furniture with Japanese influence. Tasteful and functional. Breakfast was excellent and the Tree Bar also served delicious local style food for lunch. We were encouraged to book at the Reef Restaurant for the hot pot evening - this was a really odd experience.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;denis;Surprising architecture;From the outside, the hotel looks like blocks of concrete with a minimalist aspect for furniture and decorations.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Tim C;Modern Hotel with casual relaxing vibe;We stayed for 3 days at Maya and enjoyed it thoroughly.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Rachel S;Lovely hotel for short stay;Booked the garden view hotel and was upgraded to the lagoon view room. I would stick with garden or lagoon rooms, as the ones with pool access were right near the walkway to the restaurant and pool so not very private. Rooms are lovely and spacious, large bathroom, great balcony (see photos). There are two restaurants out the front on the main strip and one at the back by the pool. Lots of nice restaurants and bars when you turn right out of the hotel. Hotel food and cocktails were really good and reasonably priced.;4;1;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Rossiters_12;Excellent hotel;"Stayed here for 8 nights in lagoon view room. Very nice rooms with good facilities; great bathroom with monster sized bath. Nice view of ocean from balcony. Breakfast buffet excellent and other restaurants on site look good but we dined outside mostly. Great choice of restaurants right on doorstep. Our daughter loved swimming up the lagoon to and from the pool. Had room service which was fast, efficient and very good quality. Price higher than on street but this is still reasonable when compared to Sydney. We would definitely use this hotel again and would recommend. Not many other children which was surprising given school holidays but not a 'fun' place, more for relaxing.";5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Bill99Z;Small but nice;Stayed at this hotel. It is a small hotel but a nice one. Breakfast was okay however had a good lunch at their restaurant by the road side. Rooms come with balcony and I found it pleasant to smoke my cigar. The bathroom is an opened one not exactly my preferred type. Amenities and features in the room is good but could use with a bit more choices for television channels. Overall, a pleasant experience and will recommend this hotel.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Tolga_O;Great luxury hotel by the sea in Bali;Beautifully designed hotel surrounded by water. Our room suite was not huge in size but comfortable. We loved our private pool overlooking the larger main pool. The suites advertised as ocean view were only partial ocean view because of the design of the hotel. The included breakfast buffet was amazing in selection and delicious. You could walk around Sanur from this resort either next to the beach or on the streets shopping. We discovered a very nice fish restaurant a short walk on the beach but you need a flash-light as part of the beach is completely dark. The only disappointment were the long algea in the water.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Bali-Bali;Nice hotel;Stayed there around a month ago. A small but a nice hotel. Room is well appointed. I like the bathroom. Ate at both restaurants.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;chjah;Excellent Hotel on the Beach;We stayed at this hotel after spending four days in Ubud. Sanur as a resort is much quieter than Ubud however it is still a fairly busy location. Hotel is nicely situated between the main road and the beach. Food in the hotel was very good from breakfast to lunchtime snacks or pizzas from the reef bar, through to the excellent Kuu Japanese restaurant. Happy hours in an evening were good on the prices although in truth apart from wine drinks are not that expensive. As elsewhere in Bali the service was excellent, attentive and wonderfully polite. The rooms, while not as spacious as the hotel in Ubud we stayed at, are still to a very high standard. We stayed in a deluxe Lagoon View room which was very good. The pool was well looked after although towels blocking sun beds was a…;5;;;;;;
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;CraigHBruce;I'll be back! New to Maya, but a convert.;Location The hotel is situated at the quieter end of a populated strip – turning left out of the hotel there’s a large gap (1km ?) before reaching the next bar and restaurant area, part of this gap represents what was the Bali Hyatt which as I understand it is being completely rebuilt. Turning right theres a great selection of local restaurants, shops and a scuba shop all right there, though the bars and restaurants are of the laid back, quiet, variety with the bigger, louder ones 1-2km further down the road. Whilst I was there most establishments were closing up at 10:30pm.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;AshleyAlexiss;Modern & welcoming!;My fiancé and I stayed here in the deluxe room with a lagoon view. Excellent hospitality, conveniently located, and many amenities all very close by. The food is delicious. The Japanese restaurant at the front of the hotel was our favorite. You must try the dragon sushi roll! DELICIOUS :) We were able to tour all the room types and we definitely fell in love with the suites. They have a private pool which I believe is a huge selling point to any room. You also have to take a walk across the rooftop. There's an entire garden up there and it's a real beautiful view of the ocean, city, and resort!;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Franzi-chan;First perfect hotel we found in our lives;We can fully recommend a stay at Maya Sanur!

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Annemarie3175;Wonderful experience we felt very spoilt;Staying at Maya resort was a real treat, my daughter and I shared a twin room and received an upgrade from the garden view room to a lagoon view which was very much appreciated. Our room was spacious with 2 double beds and seating area. The bathroom was spectacular very big but make sure you understand the hot water instructions as we couldn't work the shower out so had no hot water for the first 3 days as the 2 staff we asked were not very clear or we were just stupid maybe, we worked it out eventually maybe a little sign would help. The resort itself was right on the beach but the beach wasn't good for swimming to much seaweed and rocks. Walking along a bit further the water was clearer. The resort has free bikes so would recommend a ride along the beach promenade;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Joyce F;Five stars worthy accommodation;Stayed 3 nights at Maya Sanur. The price may be higher compared to many other resorts along the same beach but the accommodation make it worthwhile. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The location is great with access to the beach area and lots of cafes and restaurants around the area. When you feel lazy to walk out of the resort to look for food, the dining options within the resort are good too. Both the Reef and Tree Bar are great places to dine and hang out while enjoying the sea view and breeze. This part of the beach is quiet and so peaceful. Great place to catch the sunrise! I will definitely want to return to this resort on my next visit.;5;1;1;0;1;1;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;hammondjohn1;Excellent Sanur Hotel;Hard to fault. Many modern Bali hotels have small rooms.

We had a garden view room which was very spacious, extremely clean and had all the amenities you could possible want - everything had been thought of. The bathroom was pure luxury with a big bath tub and an amazing shower. The housekeepers did a fantastic job and even put the sheets down ready for you to get into at night. Breakfast had everything you could possibly wish for and more. There are 3 restaurants but we only ate at the one by the sea front. Everything we had there was absolutely delicious - it really was fantastic!;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

We felt a litle let down from this hotel as the week before was spent in a 4star hotel and this one is rated 5star. Breakfast buffet is average large range to try and please the masses. The rooms are of excellent standard though cleaning is not the best, stains on besisde table and bathroom sides. Only at in one the restraunts once which was the graze restraunt at the front I had the lamb chops and my wife had the steak both were very good quality and value for money.;4;1;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;custardpudding;Great hotel with a quiet clean beach;Highly recommend for those seeking a quiet holiday in Sanur at a nice and new beach hotel (as many beach hotels in Sanur are quite old). The lagoon view room was large, very clean, bathroom was spacious with a separate shower stall and toilet, double sinks and a large tub. The balcony had a big day-bed. We requested for a clothes drying rack so we could sun dry our wet things on the balcony. The pool is right by the beach and as is the buffet breakfast restaurant. It's a quiet beach that's very clean for Bali, and there are pretty fishing boats and local kids flying beautiful kites.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;annelandry;Fabulous hotel;Wonderful hotel. The hotel is clean, food is delicious with a choice of restaurants. Breakfast is buffet style with a variety of options including gluten fee. We had our lunches at the seafront restaurant. The Japanse restaurant is average compared to those other countries. We preferred the pool as the sea had a lot of seaweeds. The pools are nice and clean with chairs and beds. We used the laundry service of shops across the street for a fraction of the cost. They charge by the kilo as opposed to by piece, Behind the hotel is a walkway that goes for kilometres in each direction along the sea.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Having breakfast on the first morning a young lady came to our table, introduced herself and welcomed us to Bali. She asked if we had any questions or if we needed assistance at anytime do not hesitate to contact her. It was a lovely touch. Location was perfect with many great restaurants nearby. Would highly recommend Maya - Sanur. 🙏🏻;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Kathy M;Absolute Perfection on a So-So Beach;We loved the Maya Sanur Resort. The architecture throughout is both modern but with classic Balinese art and artifacts and the rooms are heavenly. The interior of the rooms is very spacious and with all amenities and so very stylish yet Balinese- a very special and pampering ambience. The outdoor patio area in the deluxe rooms feels so private: You can't see any other rooms, there is a comfortable day bed and all you can hear is birds...it's so relaxing. The pool area and restaurants are excellent. But the beach at Sanur is just OK. Nice long beach for walking and lots of choices for restaurants and shops but the ocean water is very shallow and floor of the ocean is covered with seagrass and coral which make it unattractive for entering or swimming.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Toni F;A tranquil place with great service;We stayed in a Lagoon Access room for 3 nights after a conference in Seminyak. After Seminyak, Sanur itself felt very laid back. The resort is beautifully set against the shoreline in Sanur. All crafted to blend in to the natural surroundings with an amazing rooftop garden over the entire building. The rooms are very spacious and clean, the service is outstanding. It's a quiet, relaxing environment with easy access to the beach and all the great eateries in Sanur.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;lazy-traveller-bel;Boutique style luxury;We stayed in a Lagoon View Room for 6 nights in May. We arrived very late at night and were greeted with a cold drink and cold towels while we checked in. Customer service was excellent during our stay. Nothing is too much trouble. Our room was on an upper floor and was very comfortable. The bathroom has a glass divider next to the sleeping and living area with an electric privacy shade. The bath tub was enormous and bath salts are provided (a rarity I've noticed in other hotels with a tub). The shower is spacious with a rainhead shower. The hot water seems endless! The shampoo and soap are a mystery brand as they are housed in plain pump packs but have a pleasant scent and do a decent job. There is no body lotion provided so this is something you may want to bring. The bed…;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Xanadustar;The perfect end to our Bali adventure;We spent the last four nights of our holiday in Bali at Maya Sanur and couldn't have been happier with the hotel. We booked a lagoon view room which was beautifully designed, light, airy and spacious with an enormous bed (pillow menu available), fabulous bathroom (two sinks!) and cosy balcony. Couldn't have been happier. As others have said, the reception area does have the feel of an airport terminal but belies the thought and modern aesthetic of the rooms. We loved the green walls and caged balconies festooned with hanging plants.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;coffeeleaf;Lovely hotel;Late arrival, but check in was smooth with complimentary fresh juices. Room was clean and spacious with fruit and chocolate. 4 free waters a day. I felt the slippers could be better quality, and they could have more choice of shower products to use, I guess that is being picky.. but 5 stars come with raised expectations. Breakfast was so so, I felt there could be more choice. The full english breakfast buffet just wasn't good. Could they have more oriental selections as well? Main pool is good, but the pool access rooms were not in sunlight during the day. Spa was relaxing, take up the offer of 50% off during quiet periods or it is expensive. Roof top gardens has some amazing views so make sure you check it out. Beach was dirty however, I would avoid.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Angelo1975;"Good hotel, not a ""wow factor""";I've got mixed feelings about Maya Sanur. Let me start to sum up the positive points. - great location right on the beach and within walking distance from many restaurants along the Jalan Danau Tamblingan. - Tree bar which is an excellent hangout, especially at sundown. Enjoy the view and the great cocktails. - Japanese restaurant Kuu is definitely worth a visit! - Rooftop garden with great views of the surrounding area. Now for some of the downsides. A big part of a hotel experience in my opinion is determined by the hotel room. During our visit we've stayed in a beachfront pool suite on the 1st floor (room 502).;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

The balcony looks out over the green of the garden and the pool that stretches down half of the resort. The foyer area is bland but the restaurants are warm and cheerful. You can go out onto the street at the front of the hotel and find plenty of shops and restaurants. Or you can go out onto the beach walkway and beach at the other end of the resort and also find shops and restaurants. Breakfast was great with plenty of selection. The spa offered daily specials which we enjoyed a number of times. There a number of pools to choose from as well as a roof top garden.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Theblondechefabroad;Everything about this property is AMAZING!;From the visual appearance of the outside of the property to the the front desk check in this hotel offers a relaxing and well thought out experience. sincere couple with beautiful rooms and a lovely layout of the property make this a hotel that I will keep coming back to. The rooms though...super comfortable beds with cozy blankets, huge bath tubs with soaking salts provided and whatever toiletry you could possibly need. It's such a pretty place with beach access. We tried almost all of the restaurants as well and they were all delicious with the same attention to detail and flavour. If you want to really relax and feel spoilt in Bali, the Maya Sanur is the place to do it!!;5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;kwg76;An excellent hotel;Our second visit to the Maya Sanur. You can't complaint about anything.

The swimming pool is a perfect place to relax/swim, and of course you are right by the beach as well.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;David255057;A very fine hotel - luxurious- outstanding friendly staff;We stayed at the hotel last weekend (19-21 May) following a conference at another hotel. It is very conveniently located to shops (eg Hardy's) and restaurants in Sanur. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. The pool is terrific and rarely crowded. So peaceful. One of the highlights was happy hour (5-7pm) when prices are quite reasonable for cocktails and other drinks.;5;1;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Marcin K;Very Nice Hotel;room with balcony with nice sea view, breakfast included, nice places (like bars) to spend time in the evening, relatively close to local restaurants, no loud music or disco, etc. Maya Sanur has fulfilled all the above conditions without exception. Even more - tiled path along the coast leaded you to nearby other hotels (restaurants), other small outlets - perfect walking option during sunset. We have spent 8 nights in beach front suite with private pool and it was excellent choice. No need to add that food, room and area cleanliness is perfect.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Sanur beach is inches away from and the ""beach walk"" to the right is very nice to explore with chilled bars and warungs plus great massage place No 1 in Sanur! Hotel offers so much relaxation, fantastic food, great service and outdoor cinema on the roof terrace with drinks and popcorn. The sundown bar chilling by the beach is also super nice. Rooms are fantastic, clean, designed and excellent in comfort. I need to come back here soon. Wish it was an adults only since that would make it 100% my favorite place.";5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Dimos K;Simply Divine;"This hotel has it all and is hard to flaw. The tranquil garden surroundings, the spacious elegant rooms, the ""tree house"" bar, the beach side pool, the beach itself, the location, the restaurants and the service and friendly staff make this a place we will come back to. We had a Lagoon Access Room, meaning from our room we walked onto our own terrace complete with Queen size day bed, and from our terrace we jumped into our private part of the lagoon pool (separate from the main resort pool). The room itself was excellent and really spacious. It had a very comfortable king size bed, a couch, a desk, plenty of other features like a large flat screen TV, but also the best separate bathroom complete with huge round separate bathtub.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;BubbleGirl13;Tranquil bliss;There is certainly a zen about this hotel from the arrival at reception through to the rooms. Our six night stay in a lagoon pool room was simply fantastic. The styling of the hotel is fabulous, obviously a great designer was behind the layout and room styling. Everything is close by in Sanur, with a great beach in front of the hotel. Breakfast at the hotel was lovely, we wanted for nothing. Some tips for management - only small things but as the hotel is hard to fault, no doubt you won't mind me giving my two cents! The spa - had treatments there to compare to the much cheaper prices around the hotel. Unfortunately the treatments did not compare.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Renee L;Stunning property in the heart of Sanur;This is a relatively new hotel (less than 3 years old). The design is absolutely beautiful both inside and out. The rooms are extremely luxurious with a modern design, a glass view into the bathroom (that you can block out with automatic shades), and a huge tub and shower. The pool area overlooks the ocean. The restaurant serves breakfast that has European, American, and Asian favorites. They also serve other meals, but we did not try those. This is a great boutique hotel.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Modds;Beautiful hotel;This hotel is stunning! Absolutely beautiful, with 4 great restaurants on the premises. Very clean, modern and right on the ocean. From the moment we walked in we were treated amazingly well. Nice calm ocean on the beach as well. The break is further out so can swim in the calm water.Lots of seagrass but not the most beautiful beach. But still a beautiful spot. The hotel is close to many shops and restaurants. Can easily walk in ether direction and have lots of choices.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Sinnay T;A hotel like no other;What an incredible hotel like no other! Small, boutique, modern, lovely.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;kaorik755;modern and clean hotel by the beac;this is a two year old hotel facing sanur beach. there is a gallery where works of local artists are displayed. maybe the owner is an art collector. i liked nice looking objects placed in the reception, room and so on. a different touch.the room was spacious, light and airy. service was prompt. the swimming pool was rather small though. overall i liked this hotel very much and would recommend to anyone who wants to travel to bali.;4;0;0;1;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;sthayer1;High End Service and Great Location;I spent 6 nights at this resort and the service could not have been better. They arranged 2 private yoga lessons at roughly $10 USD each. The hotel is located in the center of town, so very convenient to shops and restaurants. The hotel's beach is beautiful, and there is a five mile walking path that runs along the beach that is perfect for exercise. The room was spacious, and beautifully decorated. I highly recommend this hotel! The only thing that would have made it better was if they had beach chairs and umbrellas.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;FernWest;One of trhe very best hotel we have stayed in;We have been to Sanur but our usual hotel was not available, and we took a chance on the Maya which is nearby. What a difference ! It is a new hotel, between the beach and the main road (with a number of useful shops). The hotel is very modern , with lots of concrete and stainless steel. The plot is very long from the road and beach, but with a lot of trees, and a very long pool front to back, as well as two pools near the beach. If possible get a room on the 1st. floor,which will have your own access to the pool. There are about 2 floors above.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;beambine6308;Great....not quite awesome🤔;We stayed for nine nights 3-12 February and mostly have enjoyed our stay. The positives first..... * The rooms are very modern and comfortable and well appointed. We stayed in one of the pool access rooms. * The food has been good, the breakfasts are adequate but perhaps a little more variety may be required for longer stayers. * The location is ideal for eating out, and shopping. Now for the less positive points...from what we gathered the many pool access rooms were hardly occupied - we certainly didn't see many people in the corridors or pool. On our second night a party of Chinese tourists were put in the room next to us.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Nithya108;Attentive Staff, Pleasing Ambience;My four night stay in Maya Sanur was very comfortable. One of them hand wrote all the items on their menu that could be veganized and gave it to me. It's one of the prettiest hotels I have stayed in. Beach access. Modern and clean rooms. A cosy nesting nook in the balcony. I noticed a few mosquitoes in my room each evening.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Wade B;Amazing location in Sanur;Great new hotel in Sanur. Facilities are amazing. Great location reaches down to the beach where the resturaunt and tree bar are located. Many rooms have their own access to the pool that runs down through the centre of the property. Breakfast buffet is very good with alot of options. A great place to relax and unwind and get away from the hustle and bustle of the main streets in Bali.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Bali-dreaming;Loved it;Initially stayed at the Fairmont hotel which is just a short distance from the Maya. Had struggled to decide which of the two to book and we really enjoyed both. We booked two pool access rooms and were really happy we did. The decor of the hotel is really light and bright and the place has a really positive energy. Loved walking from our balcony straight into the pool which runs the length of the resort. The main pool was also nice but we spent the majority of our time in what seemed like our own private pool.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;anne J;Happy hour cocktails;We were staying close by to the Maya so would walk pass everyday. Beautifully decorated for Christmas and the decor very inviting. We dropped in for a happy hour after New Years and had a couple of cocktails. We laid back on lounges while watching people pass by and watching the sunset. they had toilets to use which were very clean and beautiful. Staff lovely. Would return here.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Sarah D;Great service, beautiful hotel;We had a lovely time at the hotel. It is exactly like an art gallery. The hotel is open and has a 200m long pool running through its centre. It has lovely plants everywhere and the roof garden is great to look out at the view of the beach, water and sanur. The pool area is very luxe and the room itself was spacious and very lovely. The breakfast buffet is also excellent. I got sick unforunatley and we rang reception - they had a doctor and a nurse to my room in 20 minutes flat. So good, as I certainly was in no condition to travel, and I wouldn't have known where to go for a doctor. The hotel even let us stay in the room up until our flight the next day, which was after check out time, to let me recuperate. …;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;solis;One of My Favorite Resorts;Amazing resort, we stayed in the garden view room. It's one of my favorite resort not just in Bali but anywhere. Highlights are: Beautiful and modern resort: Pool area has good view of the beach and nice lounge chairschairs/booths to relax in. 3 level bar right next to the pool where you can also get full view of the beach. All the areas look modern. Great room: We got the garden view. The layout is very comfortable and the style is modern. Clean. There's a pillow menu of 4-5 different types of pillow if you don't like the default one. Bathroom tub comes with bath salt. It's a rooftop path that connects the front and back of the resort and its covered with nice soft grass.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Audrey B;A place to while away your time while being pampered;This is a true 5 star hotel. The hotel itself is not too big and that's why they can maintain it well. The beach is short, has white sand, and the water is very calm, you dont have to worry too much about the kids playing in the water. The room is spacious and bright. The bathroom has a huge bathtub which the kids love.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;kesmith0381;Wonderful!;"We stayed at the Maya Sanur for four nights and could not have been happier.

The also really enjoyed the tree top bar; the top floor has great views and is a very good place catch the sunset. The location is good as there are lots of good restaurants close by, as well as mini marts, pharmacies and ATMs. We really enjoyed our time here and will definitely return in the future. Highly recommended!";5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Triinu K;Super holiday in Sanur :);Maya Sanur hotel has very good location and facilities. Hotel itself is very clean, comfy. Best rooms are with lagoon acess. There is a possibility to take yoga classes every morning, use fitness centre, take cooking classes and from hotel is direct access to the beach. We enjoyd our stay very very much and hope to back real soon.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;SarahYu;Best for Sanur;It's a nice tranquil resort to stay. Hence the morning complimentary session is always fully packed. Swimming pool and beach bar are also quite cozy. The rooms are spacious and well designed. Although there was a strange ordor in the bathroom. Sanur itself is a bit touristy hence not my favourite in Bali. But if you are to stay in Sanur, Maya would be a good choice for its Art Deco design, warm service and cozy environment.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Leon S;Top Class;I chose The Maya Sanur Resort and Spa because of its beach front location away from the bustle and noise of Kuta. My room was presented well complete with balcony set in a tropical setting. The bathroom was large and functional with a wonderful rain shower. My bed was firm but comfortable. My pillows were soft. There was no outside noise to contend with. I slept very well. Breakfast was located in a beautiful setting overlooking the lagoon. The breakfast selections were excellent with a good selection of fruit and pastries. I thought breakfast supervision was perhaps a little lacking.;5;0;0;0;1;0;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Yvette K;Beautiful hotel;Stayed here for three nights for some rest and relaxation and that is exactly what we got - the hotel is absolutely beautiful - the rooms were pristine with all the amenities available - the breakfast was plentiful and set in tranquil surroundings - the pool area and tree top bar for sundowner cocktails were also magnificent;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

We had luck as was not a lot rain and was not so fully booked. Worth every penny!;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Philip W;Perfect off season hotel;We spent 5 nights at this hotel in December and it felt like our private hotel. Staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. After 3 days of having the pool to ourselves we decided to upgrade to a private pool room and got this upgrade for a very reasonable $100 per night! My wife had a medical problem and the front desk had a doctor cal us within 10 minutes and attend our room within 30 minutes. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious stay with local colour just outside the front door.;5;1;0;1;0;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;mrspascoe;One of the best resorts we have ever stayed in!;This is a truly beautiful hotel. If you're into architecture this is the place for you. The design of the hotel looks like a modern day Balinese temple. From the street you wonder if it's even a hotel. Once inside it fails to amaze you. We were upgraded from the base room to a bigger suite on arrival which was great. The room was spotless! Housekeeping should be very proud. The pool was great, plenty of shade if you didn't want to sit in the sun. Each sun bed area had a button on the table which you pressed for service and the waiter came very quickly. Even the hotel food was great. Breakfasts were more than ample and for someone like me it was a great surprise to find a selection of gluten free breads and pastries om the buffet. We had dinner…;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;traveltilithurts;A new property with a gorgeous pool area right on the beach and close to dive centers!;"I was in Bali for 2 nights only and I found the Maya Sanur to be very lovely. It's essentially a new property and is gorgeously designed. Splurge for the lagoon access room or do what I do and really splurge for the suite with a private plunge pool (that's actually quite big). The rooms aren't ""grand"" but they are very comfortable. (One small thing - there are no amenities - no lotion, etc. - so pack your own). That it was a 10 minute ride to my dive center was a huge bonus. Less time on the road and more time in bed or relaxing. This is on the Eastern side of the island which is quieter - and I liked that part - no obnoxious party sounds from the neighborhood.";4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;MarkLoxton;Fantastic;Our first visit to Bali, and we decided to stay away from the busy side of the island. Quite simply, the Maya is a stunning hotel and we loved it. We paid a little extra for a ground floor pool access room, and it was money well spent. I had the use of a 50m lap pool that runs the length of the building.( There are 3 of these pools.). The beach side main pool area is also great. The rooms are beautiful too. We particularly liked the Tree Bar for Happy Hour cocktails in the evening. I don't think I will look for anything else when we come back to Bali.;5;1;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;EmmaCarmel;Short stay at stunning resort;Absolutely loved our 2 night stay at the Maya Resort Sanur. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, modern and large with several pools and different areas to enjoy. Hotel is beach front and you can walk a short distance to restaurants and bars. Enjoyed happy hour at the tree bar for half priced cocktails and acoustic music and the breakfast buffet has a huge range.Also handy if you have a late flight out of Bali is the hotels departure lounge. It is an air-conditioned space with couches, a TV and showers available for your use after you have checked out.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;AnaPhylaxis2014;Wonderful Oceanside Resort;"The Maya resort in Sanur is stunning. We loved our room with private balcony. The bathroom was gorgeous and about the size of our room and bathroom in Hong Kong. The room was spacious and light-filled, and very modern. We enjoyed breakfast at the Reef restaurant, sitting out on little ""islands"" in the pool, and the main pool was lovely, with shady areas you could retreat to. The beach itself is not the best in Sanur, however. It is very small and the hotel doesn't put out lounge chairs on the sand, probably because there is very little room there. However, you can sit on the pool deck above and gaze out to sea. The hotel also has bikes that you can borrow to take a ride on the very long boardwalk in Sanur. You can take them on the street as well, but the traffic makes that a…";5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Marcella;Wow amazing!;we went 7 nights in November. From airport to the hotel is 20 min by car. The temperature in Bali vary from 25-32 degrees in this period. Sometimes it rains, but mostly after 6pm and during the night. Transfer from the airport is 325k rupiah if arranged by the hotel. Taxi is cheaper but not worth the hassle. Positive things will come first in this review, because this is a very good hotel. We had room 202 (on 2nd floor) for 7 nights. Close to the lobby/pool and restaurants. Room has all the amenities one needs for a comfortable stay. Room is big enough, interior looks up to date. Airco, balcony, safe, hot shower, closets, coffee/tea facility and free (reliable) wifi. There is a big pool and some rooms have their own swim up pool from the room and also the premises…;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Cele W;Excellent........;Maya Sanur is a quiet, peaceful and clean resort with excellent facilities. The design of this hotel is outstanding (one of the best in Bali) credit to the designers. The place is so peaceful and quiet. The beach is right at the hotel you just need to walk to it and enjoy the views of the Sanur beach.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;gfchjfghfgjgfjgfh;True hospitality;"We would like to thank Juni for an amazing stay at Maya, Sanur. We bought a discounted upgrade to the lagoon access room (still costly but worth it). Juni put in a lot of effort to me sure our rooms we next to each other. She even called 2 days later to check on how we were doing. The rooms were really amazing and the hotel itself is neatly clean and stylish, but could use a little more ""cozyness"". The food was good, we recommend the japanese restaurant Kuu (one of the hotel restaurants). If i have to critisize: the lunch and breakfast staff made some errors here and there. But to be honest this is more of a general indonesian listening and language thing you find everywere in Indonesia.";5;1;0;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Uginoon;Great place to stay!;rooms are new and clean, overall a superb experience. Also a great place to rest and relax.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;david h;Probably 4½ stars;we had a couple of stays at this hotel in between travelling to different areas within the region. we stayed in the most 'basic' garden view room and also one of the pool suites. The rooms are generally very similar in size and are a good size without being too large. The view from the garden room was pretty basic and these rooms are about 120 metres from the main pool, bar and restaurant. Happy Hour at the bar was good value and the 'Tree bar' had a great view of the beach. The gym was quite good bur could do with a Concept2 rower but was hardly ever used. Overall the hotel is in the heart of Sanur with an abundance of restaurants to choose from.;4;1;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Hannah M;Beautiful property;I would have given this hotel an excellent but for the fact that the two nights we stayed I was woken in the night by thumping banging sounds, seemed related to the building and possible weather conditions. The place has a lovely feel to it, rooms super modern. Breakfast is great, pastries amazing. The pool is also very pretty and there is a lovely bar and decking area nearby where you can relax. Tried spa but the appointment was rushed and finished 30 minutes early, I did point this out and received the most excellent treatment the next day, so I was happy with that. Not sure if I would book in again though as sleep quality is important.;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;TrishB08;Wonderful hotel highly recommended;Just spent three beautiful days at the Maya. I loved the architecture - not traditional Balinese but calm and the greenery hanging from the balconies is spectacular. Rooms are spacious and very well appointed. I had the best sleep I can remember in many years on my first night there. The Tree Bar down by the pool and looking over the ocean is a great place to relax with a drink and is very well priced during happy hour (5-7). Breakfast has a wide selection of food and good coffee. I loved my stay here and would visit again for sure. This was my fist time staying in Sanur (usually stay in Canngu) and found it really pleasant - good shopping and no hassle. I thought this hotel was fabulous value for money.;5;1;0;0;1;0;1

The rooms are high tech with a sleek finish, but with local Balinese elements. Sleep quality is high because the hotel is in a quiet area. The rooms have all necessary amenities (including mosquito repellent) and are very clean with comfortable beds. Wifi works well. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in the area.;5;0;1;0;1;1;1

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Neil McArthur;Simply the Best!;Modern, exceptionally clean and very high quality 5* Hotel in a great location directly on the clean Beach (no hustlers), and in the centre of Sanur. Loads of independent Bars. Just perfect. Three top-class lovely restaurants, serving quality food at a reasonable prices, (not too expensive). Especially evening snacks in the Tree House overlooking the Ocean is wonderful. If you want quality & cleanliness in a relaxed idyllic environment, I would defiantly recommend the Maya as the best hotel in Sanur.;5;1;1;0;0;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;FredericSiebold;Beautiful resort in Sanur;Maya Sanur has a modern design. Some might say it looks lifeless but I liked all the corners and straight edges and colors. The resort is located right on the beach of Sanur. However, I preferred to swim and relax at the pool instead on the beach. There is one really long pool, connecting all the ground level rooms with the pool. That means direct pool access from your ground level room. I loved that! Another pool is located on the beach. Only a small wall and a little path separate the infinity pool with the beach. It is a really beautiful pool, perfect to relax and drink a cocktail from the bar next to it. Like the entire hotel, the rooms are really modern and well designed with a lot of glass. The rooms are big, luxurious…;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;NeilC5;Lovely place to stay for a few days;We stayed here for 1 night on route back to HK from Lombok. Lovely hotel and great pool overlooking Sanur beach. Rooms well appointed with double sinks and a huge bath. Not sure the lagoon access is worth it as you can't really swim anywhere useful! Pool Is popular and can be hard to find spare sun loungers. Food is very good.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Timmi002;Beautiful hotel, great location;I stayed here for a work trip to Bali - I know, poor me :-) The hotel was gorgeous with lovely rooms. Balcony was super peaceful. Large artistic pieces of beautiful balinese wood scattered around the property, including the rooms. Pool area was super nice, as well as the bar there near the water. Great views at sunrise. Nice path on the beach that goes for several kilometers - great for a morning walk or run. The beach itself isn't as nice as on the west side of the island - too much seaweed. The breakfast spread was amazing, as was its setting. My only complaint wasn't the hotel's fault. Sanur is sleepy and full of families and honeymooners/couples. So as a single person or someone who wants nightlife and energy, Sanur is not…;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Brad W;Sensational Sanur;We had five nights in Sanur staying at the beautiful Maya Resort and loved every minute of it. All the staff at the Maya were fantastic, so helpful and friendly at any hour of the day. The room that we had was spacious and spotless with a super comfy king bed. We would certainly return to the Maya. Forgot to mention that there are plenty of good restaurants just a short walk from the Maya.;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Lynda T;Feeling the bliss, pampered and relaxed;Thanks Maya Sanur I'm loving my stay with you! It's day 3 of our 2nd stay here this trip. The rooms are decorated beautifully, clean, and fresh with a really comfy king sized bed. We step outside our room to the lagoon pool to relax on the lounge then take a dip in the pool - easy way to keep cool. Another great thing about the hotel is that they accommodate for a gluten free diet. This is one of the best all rounder luxury hotels I have stayed in Bali.;5;0;0;0;1;1;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;VillaCandiMatahari;Well done.....;I took a chance on this relatively new resort, and was pleasantly surprised. While in Sanur, I usually stay at the Fairmont, but will now make Maya Sanur my regular place....and I recommend you do also. The morning breakfast buffet is ENORMOUS and delicious. Rooms were modern but with a touch of Bali style. Service, excellent, and I found the location to be superior to the Fairmont as it is closer to the better part of Sanur, and the beach board walk is nicer.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Adrian D;A good Hotel;It is ideally located on the waterfront. Rooms are large and nicely decorated. Breakfast is varied with quality products. The pool is small but beautiful and have everything you need around you to feel good. The beach is ok but if you want to swim can do until 11am because reflux when water drops at 50 cm. They are around a lot of restaurants and bars that you get on the road from beaches.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Michael Ioannou;Dreaming honeymoon!!;The room we stayed was beautiful and looked like a small apartment.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;smokyharry;tranquil holiday;This resort is only a few years old , and benefits from everything being fairly new. The Rooms are really good, well thought out and comfortable to be in. We had a lagoon room, which meant you had your own private island outside your door with direct access to the pool. The hotel is super quiet, and really a solid build, but might just lack a bit of atmosphere. All up, great spot, great food and access to the beach.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;EWR-NJ-traveler;Wonderful luxury property;"We stayed here for 5 nights in a top floor room. The hotel is very modern; people have criticized that there is no/little flavor of Bali but this is quite evident from the hotel website. I have been to Bali many times and appreciated the clean, minimalist feel of the hotel for a change. The rooms are well outfitted with plenty of space in the room to spread out beach stuff, purchases and electronic gear. Plenty of charging space provided.";5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;johnlwade;Luxury in Sanur;On our last visit to Bali we spent three days at the newest resort in Sanur. After having visited the site at the start of construction a couple of years ago, you can only marvel at the result that has been achieved. Like all of the groups' hotels, nothing has been left out. Maya Sanur is situated on the beach front and provides a comfortable and peaceful venue to help holiday makers unwind, away from the stresses of the workplace. The well appointed room have all of the latest mod cons. We stayed on the ground floor with access to the pool at our back door. It is a very relaxing venue close to small market areas on the beachfront, warungs and restaurants both beach front and in adjoining streets and a short walk from Hardie's department…;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Rochie65;Lovely hotel , great location;Maya Sanur was a great hotel,. The rooms were a good size and nicely appointed. We paid for a lagoon access room which was great , however we got no sun on the verandah at any stage throughout our stay.We were the only people who swam in the lagoon pool. The were 2 other pools , one by the beach that had plenty of lounge chairs and beds around and another smaller one in the middle of the property. You could walk out onto the street for shops and restaurants, use complimentary push bikes to ride around and discover the local area.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;MickyMcCrae_VIC;Comfortable modern hotel with beachfront location;My wife and I stayed 8 nights at Maya, mid July. Hotel approximately 2 years old so very modern & located in better part of Bali. Lagoon access room spacious with all modern conveniences including dual bathroom basins (a must!). Daybed located through large glass doors out onto lagoon pool which extends entire length of that wing right down to main pool and tree-top bar. Slight downside to that location was fact that other guests walk down path to main pool area & beach in view of room. In hindsight, rooms 101 to 105 with separate pools (2) would have been more private & away from main walkway. Beach just across boardwalk very clean & safe to swim at. Would definitely…;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

The breakfast buffet is plentiful and of very good quality and it offers good dinner options and very affordable drinks at the poolside bar. All in all, there really is nothing bad to say about this place. For anyone looking for a relaxed beach getaway, I strongly urge you to give it a try.;5;1;0;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Bart112;Flawless experience;We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in a Lagoon view room. (free upgrade upon arrival) This hotel is great in everything they have to offer. The rooms are spacious, clean with a modern high end look. Bathroom admit ties are of a high standard. Upon arrival the reception will take you to the room to explain the facilities. Ok this hotel is not cheap but it's worth every cent. The pool is great and not crowded there is a towel service and plenty of room to relax in the sun or in the shade.;5;1;0;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;312fleurc;Perfect in every way;My husband and I visited Sanur for a friends wedding and treated ourself to the lagoon access room at the Maya. Everything from our airport transfer to the tree top bar was incredible. The room was luxurious - spacious even with a huge bath and king size bed, beautifully finished with lots of extra touches such as pillow choices, fruit, marble and a fantastic day bed outside for reading, happy hour drinks and snoozing after a swim. We loved the happy hour at the Tree bar from 5pm til 7pm where we not only enjoyed half price cocktails but the view of the local fishermen. Our breakfast was included and it was a treat being able to choose between two different locations every morning. Location wise we could not fault it - a short walk to everything and especially Cosmo spa;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Rob P;A lovely place to relax;Generally a lovely hotel with the service you'd expect. Nothing is too much trouble. Has a great location (main entrance off Sanur beach road, rear entrance from the beach walkway). Plenty of bars and restaurants easy walking on main road or beach walkway with lots of options. Quite lovely at tree bar in happy hour but then quite a down so need to go out if you're after a bit more colour. Highly recommend to anyone who fancies a little lux in an attractive and peace ful setting with the option of venturing out if u fancy a bit more bustle.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Traveltomtom;Lovely quiet resort on a great location;The resort has an impressive long pool that connects all the ground floor rooms as they have direct pool access. Really loved this feature so make sure to get a room at the ground floor. The rooms are very modern and in minimalistic style. I really loved the rooms and the huge glass bathroom. For privacy you let down the automated blinds. But the massive glass wall separating the bedroom from the bathroom was a great feature. There was also a huge bathtub. The breakfast is lovely with a wide range of western and Asian food. We did not eat at the beach restaurant, though we tried the Japanese restaurant on the streetside. Great quality Japanese food, delicious sushi. I reviewed Kuu Bali also here on Tripadvisor. The resort has a beachfront and a pool with a view.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;totallyBean;Didn't exactly feel like staying in 5 star but very good service;Not exactly a luxury hotel. The hotel lobby looks rather lifeless.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Budi H;Oase in Sanur Area;Located strategicaly in the Sanur main street and face beach front, with its unique design inspire by Maya temple, Maya Sanur stod out from other hotel in area. Walking down the loby, and walk into hotel room, with its lush garden and lagoon around hotel room, it soothe noise of crowded Sanur and heat from rhe beach. The room itself not too large, but with modern design give wide perspective and cozy feel. The amenities is not as good quality as Maya Ubud. Breakfast is average, but since the restaurant face beachfront, it help guest to enjoy breakfast with its scenary. Trued Ku'u japanese restaurant and also Grace, but the food is just average. The spa also as not as good as Mayaa ubud.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;tlccva;Unique design and service;The rooms are large and the bathroom larger. The tub is round and big enough for our 6 year old to sleep in. He claimed he was going to when he saw the tub. We had a nice large balcony with a multi-person lounger. We wandered up to the roof one day and found a lawn. The room is covered with lawn and plants. At one end it has temples. Various flowers are present, well manicured. The pool area was nice, but very few people swam or sat by the pool. Pool service was non-existent. Each time I needed something I had to mention it to the bar. At that point they were wonderful. Maybe the culture is different and pool service is not expected. The work out room was skimpy but better than many I have seen. It had one basic weight machine that could handle various exercises.;5;0;0;1;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;朱的多國旅記;One of the best;Staying in Maya Sanur is one of the most enjoyable experience of lifetime. My fond memory about the hotel was sitting at the bar, enjoying the breakfast, while listening to the jazz music and glazing into the beautiful Indian ocean. We enjoyed everything about the hotel - the beautiful hotel grounds and designs, the comfortable room with internet TV, genuine hospitality, and a sense of calm and privacy. Sanur is most recommended for a romantic getaway, a nice small village 30min from the airport. Maya Sanur is the place to stay. Don't forget to visit the Batu Jimbar bar, a famous Bali restaurant which is just 5-10min walking distance from the hotel.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

The rooms are both highly original and of a very high standard. My wife and I stayed in a ground-floor, lagoon room with direct access to a long and narrow swimming pool – perfect first thing in the morning or after a long day’s sightseeing. If you arrive after 16.00 the tide may be out, but do not despair - in the morning the tide will be in and you will have a beautiful place to swim in the ocean. The swimming pool is a delight and the Tree Bar is an ingenious twist on the traditional pool bar.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Bambang W;Sunrise and serenity;After spending 2 night in kuta area, I moved to Sanur area. Initially I was afraid that I might not enjoyed my stay in Sanur since the area is less vibrant than kuta or seminyak. It turned out to be the best stay I ever had in Bali so far. I stayed at deluxe lagoon acces room with direct acces to small pool from my room's terrace. The pool is perfect for soaking up or just laying down reading some book in the garden's large sofas. For a more active swimming go to main pool nearby the beach. The room is spacious. The bathroom is equipped with separate shower and large bathub. It was totally a relaxing stay, I just spend most my time at the pools and have some drinks at the bars with friend. The beach bar offer the best view of the beach.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;RADESAI;A Stay to remember....;We are a family of 3 on our first trip to Bali ! Stayed at Maya Sanur for 05 nights and had an absolutely AMAZING time ! The hotel has a lagoon going around the ground floor rooms - the rooms actually have a small balcony which opens into the lagoon ! Kids are not allowed to stay in these rooms though -( We stayed in a room on the 4th floor with a nice, large bathroom with a huge tub (our son had a blast !)... Each room has a balcony with a sea facing view, however its better to stay in rooms beyond 10 and above (say 410, 411 etc.) to get the sea view. This is a new hotel with very good amenities - nice Coffee Shop & Restaurant, an excellent neighbourhood with an ATM, Taxi shop & lots of nice restaruants within walking distance.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Descelt;A touch of luxury;I wish I had booked for more nights at this hotel. We spent the last 3 nights of our holiday here and it redeemed our holiday in Bali. Check in was smooth with juice and cold towels. We upgraded from a lagoon view room (2nd floor) to a lagoon access room on the ground floor. This meant that I could swim in the lagoon straight from the room. There was also a day bed on the terrace section outside both the view and access room. Very good for relaxing on. The rooms are spacious with very large bathrooms including a bath tub. Only thing you have to be aware of with the lagoon access room is that guests and staff walk past the room on the path to the main swimming pool. This did not bother me, but it might bother some with regards to privacy.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Shimmy88;Excellent hotel, amazing staff and access to beach;Love love LOVE this resort!

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;HiromiYato;My favorite home in Sanur;After the Nyepi day, I’ve stayed in Maya Sanur again.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Barba23rossa;Very good beachfront hotel;A new - built 2015 - and modern styled design hotel direct at the Sanur beachfront, the Maya is a good choice for your holiday trip to Sanur.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;ttr331;Heaven on earth;A former flight attendant I have traveled extensively around the world . We stayed at Maya Sanur and departed on March 30, 2016. It truly is one of the very best resorts I have stayed in. Our private pool suite was just DEVINE. The room spacious, every thought was considered to provide the guest the best stay. International wall adapters built in the wall for convenience , hand held and rain showers in bathroom. Massive round tub to soak the day away, an infinity private pool with views. An impressive glass obsevertry with ferns and plants as a bed wall was simply visually beautiful. Automatic blinds to enjoy the sunrise and sunset.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;globalcitizen;Gorgeously designed modern resort with friendly staff;The Maya Sanur has all the luxuries of a resort. We had the garden view room, and it looked onto the long pool and trees from the balcony. The bathroom was huge, with 2 sink areas, a nice bathtub, and a walk-in shower. Every detail is thoughtfully designed. The rooms were airy and modern, and the pools are amazing. The included breakfast buffet at Reef was delicious. It's also right on the beach, which seems to be frequented by local families and fisherman and not so many tourists, so you get a more authentic feel of the Bali beaches. I heard this is the only hotel resort in Sanur, so you don't get the super touristy vibe in the neighborhood.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Mahsa M;Amazing design and service;We loved everything about this hotel specially the design. Rooms are beautiful and every element is practical. Nice balcony in our lagoon view room, even though the weather was too hot to be able to sit outside. The design of the outdoor areas such as roof garden, swimming pool, outdoor restaurant and bar also amazing. Lucky us that got a free upgrade from garden view room to lagoon view room which has an amazing bath tub. There's also a pillow menu in the room for more comfort. We also got an hour of Balinies massage for both of us as a gift which was also amazing. The location is very convenient and you'll find everything you need in a short walking distance such as supermarket, exchange office, souvenir shop, drug store and much more;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;judeloc;Wonderful Hotel & Staff!;Just returned from a 9 night stay here (room 102-garden view). Gorgeous massive room & bathroom, cleaned daily to a high standard. The room contained a safe large enough for our laptop, iron & board, hairdryer & all toiletries. Loads of power sockets including USB. The hotel is very modern & kept very clean. Alot of choice for Breakfasts which are cooked to order. Had a massage in their Spa - very good price & the best I have ever had anywhere in the world! The hotel is well located with loads of bars,shops, restaurants within easy walking distance either roadside or beachside.;5;1;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Wetravelalot12;Nice quite location on the sea;We stayed here for 4 nights from Tuesday 8th March. Located on the beach, this is a truly lovely hotel. The rooms are clean and spacious and modern with a few local touches. The taxi ride was around 20mins from the airport. Outside the hotel, there are local shops, bars and restaurants.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;ASougy;Lived up to great reviews.;Our first time staying at the Maya. Lived up to the good reviews we read before booking. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was perfect. Beds were very comfortable with a big range of pillows. Three restaurants to pick from. 3 level bar built around a tree right on the beach. We loved it. Only negative for those that like the traditional Balinese gardens, this property does not have them. You have to go onto the roof to see the garden.;5;0;0;0;1;0;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Vickiinaz;Interesting architecture;We enjoyed our stay. The hotel is immaculate, conveniently located and the rooms are large and lovely.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;ALF1971;Simple and beautiful hotel;What interesting about this hotel is its simple and beautiful architecture. If you love wooden furnitures with a bit of Japanese influence, you will also love this hotel. It is located right in the middle of Sanur area, so you can easily walk from this hotel to most cafe/restaurant, shop and supermarket once you go out of the hotel. When we arrive at the hotel there is a lit pathway that leads you to lobby and then you will see the intriquing bird cage-like balcony overview the swimming pool and the sanur beach at far end. You will also enjoy their roof top bar and garden to see the beautiful sanur sunrise. The room itself, is not too big but very well designed. I especially love the bathroom design and the writing desk and chair. The balcony have a cute day bed.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;207heidi;Sensational Sanur !!!!!!!!!!!!!!;We have been to Bali many times and stayed all over the island. Maya Sanur is by far the most outstanding 5 star resort that we have ever stayed at. There is absolutely nothing i can critic on,from lovely staff to the cleanest rooms and pools.It is so tranquil,you will not want to leave. Usually we never eat in the resort but as i said we could not tear ourselves away,except for some bike rides on their free bikes. The food was delicious and affordable.(which isn't the case in a lot of 5 star resorts). We have never felt so relaxed and really enjoyed a massage as well. The architecture of the building is just breathe-taking and believe it or not its more breath-taking in real life than the website photos. As you can tell we loved this place. Do you yourself a favour and get to…;5;;;;;;
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Julie S;Beautiful new hotel with ocean frontage;This is a very new hotel and rates very highly. Situated on the beach where swimming and boating is available. The rooms are beautifully appointed and the bathroom is spectacular. All rooms have a spacious balcony with day bed for relaxing. Ground floor suites have a private pool. This hotel was designed by a talented Balinese architect and the final result is stunning, although the entrance is still a work in progress and many ideas are being explored. There are Balinese artworks and memorabilia scattered throughout the lobby and these are a talking piece.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;JanisHazlewood;Lovely Stay at Maya;We stayed at the Maya Sanur in November - it is a lovely hotel. We stayed in a standard room and it is walk you would expect - basic with no real storage for clothes (did not matter to us as we were leaving after 2 nights) but the room was clean and the bed was also very comfortable. We enjoyed the boardwalk on the beach - you could walk for a long time in each direction and enjoy the beautiful beach and just hop in the ocean to cool off. The one recommendation I would make would be to request a room away from the lobby and closer to the beach/pool.;4;0;1;0;1;1;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Sostin;One of the best in Bali;We've stayed in a lot of different hotels and a lot of different parts of Bali and the Maya was up there as one of the best. The design of the resort is very clever as it creates a feeling of being vast and spacious but it is actually quite small. The bonus of being small is that you also get the feeling of intimacy and privacy about the place. Overall the resort feels very luxurious and romantic. The room itself was beautifully decorated and 5 star. The Maya definitely deserves its 5 star trip advisor rating.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Neil B;Away from the Crush;Was only there 1 night , but it was like an oasis in the midst of Denpasar. The room had all the usual amenities for a 5 star hotel, and the bed linen was of good quality with a choice of pillow. I enjoyed a lunch at the hotel followed later by a cocktail party and the food standard was excellent.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Helen S;Fantastic hotel with great service;We stayed here for the last two nights of a three week Bali trip , the only disappointment was that we didn't have longer. The hotel is new , beautiful clever design , the rooms are huge , with great bathrooms and I think they have literally thought about every little detail for there guest . The pool area is beautiful with lovely view of the beach . The gym and spa facilities good. The hotel is well located at the quieter end of the street with lots of places on your doorstep to go to. We much preferred Sanur to Seminyak as a resort , plenty to do but relaxing and chilled out .;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;lindyloo-2007;Fabulous looking hotel - very modern;Stayed at this hotel for two nights before leaving for home and for my daughter's birthday. We had a garden view room which had a distant view of the sea overlooking trees. Great for watching sunrise early in the morning. Two large beds, slightly hard for those that like a softer bed but still comfy. Nice pillows with a pillow menu to change if needed. Fab bathroom with large free standing bath, walk in shower, twin sinks and loo.;4;0;0;0;1;0;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Shaleene S;Unforgettable stay!;It was the perfect place to stay. The room was very spacious. The pool was bigger than it looks in the picture and we were most pleased to see that the resort lived up to the website (not always the case). We found the beds so comfortable that I think we need to now replace ours at home to replicate the wonderful sleep we had there. What can I say about the location. It was great. The resort is on the main street of Sanur. For anyone who knows Sanur, Warung Mak Beng is just a straight walk down along the beach!;5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Ros C;Beautiful hotel and lovely staff;We spent the last six nights of our honeymooon here and absolutely loved it.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;HugoColle;Beautiful modern hotel;Been in Bali few times already but first time i stayed in Sanur. The Maya resort is a beautiful hotel with a very nice design. I stayed in a room with lagoon view on second floor and it was a stunning view. The rooms are spacious, bright and very clean. Bathroom has all what it needs and is also spacious. The pool is nearby the beach, nice and big but sometimes bit windy.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Rebecca T;Perfect;We've been staying here for four nights and everything is perfect here. The room is clean, spacious with a relaxing balcony. The decoration is modern with a fusion of traditional Bali touch. Plus the comfy king size bed. An excellent room indeed. Location is. Perfect as well. Many nice restaurants in the main street outside the hotel. At the back of the hotel is a long seaside walkway which is perfect for jogging.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;dan_muli;Perfect spot for a relaxing few days;I had not been to Sanur before, only seminyak and I much prefer Sanur. Relaxing beach vibes, a great strip of restaurants and bars on the beach without the crazy price tag of seminyak. The Maya is a stunning property throughout. Convenient location to get out and about around town, swim in the beach or just laze by the pool. It was perfect for our short 4 day getaway. We booked a lagoon room which is a nice touch if you're a water baby, great to roll out of bed and in for a swim each morning to wake yourself up. But in reality all the rooms are nicely placed, even the garden villas had a pool out front.;5;1;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;da_griswalds;Sensational stay in Sanur;Sophisticated, modern, tranquil, romantic, great food, superb spa services and clean, clean, clean.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Aine G;The best hotel we ever stayed in!;Our garden view room was upgraded to a lagoon facing room which was amazing! The room was spacious and modern with a gorgeous double bathroom and a large balcony with a comfy lounger. I bought one of the blue bath robes from the room as a keepsake of our stay! Check out is usually at 12pm but we were given a late check-out to suit our flight departure times, another bonus!;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Ben T;By Far the best in Sanur;My wife and 8 month old son travelled here for a getaway for 5 nights, just so i could do work from Bali and relax. The hotel is absolutely stunning, from the moment we walked in the high ceilings, cleanliness, designer touches and modern eco style immerses the natural with the man-made perfectly. I have read reviews saying it wasn't child friendly - this is sort of true because of the extensive private lagoon that surrounds all the ground floor suites, but we just kept the door closed and our son was fine.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;TravellingBudha;One of the best new hotel in Sanur;Has been staying 4 times at this new establishment. Excellent, spacious rooms, good location in sanur main road, nice bar, japanese restaurant kuu can be a little bit up market, breakfast buffet needs variety after 3 consecutive nights at the property. Walking from check in counter to the room near breakfast area can be a bit far especially when the electronic keys did not work!;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;VickiGus;Timeless elegance in a tranquil, seaside setting;We have just returned home from spending 7 glorious nights at Maya Sanur. This world class resort sharpens all your senses, and evokes a deep appreciation for nature and all its elements. All rooms are elegant, spacious and light with spectacular ocean views. The design and architecture invites you to experience the evolving landscape of Bali, set amidst the tranquil beachfront and charming street side of Sanur. Graze was a favourite of ours, set on the street side, has an extensive menu that will not disappoint.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;kn1901;Best hotel in Sanur;Had a lovely 8 night stay in MAYA in July. Our Lagoon View Room was really spacious, and the bathroom was beautiful. Large and inviting. The bed is very comfortable. The hotel is a perfect mix of traditional Balinese architecture, and modern design, blending in nicely. From the streets it looks like a historic building, but when you enter it, you see a modern and sleek looking complex. We stayed at the pool every day and just went down to the beach for a quick dip every now and then. The restaurants were really good and not too pricy at all. We dined at Graze, Reef and also Izakaya, all three very good restaurants.;5;0;0;0;1;0;1
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;aoc134;Gorgeous beachside resort;Maya Sanur has beautiful rooms that are elegantly decorated and provide everything you need.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Melissa217;Modern Oasis in Paradise;"I came here to with a spa package called ""Sunset at Sanur"" and fell in love with the place. The property is beautiful, modern and chic. They gave us a room tour after our spa treatment and I booked a night here on the spot. Our room was very modern with the balcony. I really like the yoga class and the continental breakfast. The pools are great and you can lounge pool side or at the bar oceanfront. They also have happy hour 5-7pm with half off drinks. Everything was great. They made my trip to Bali very nice. I would definitely be back.";5;0;0;1;1;0;0

The bathroom design was amazing. We started each day with yoga and a walk along the beach boardwalk. We ended each day at happy hour in the tree bar, lychee martinis are recommended,with amazing view of the beach and the local fisherman, then a walk to one of the many local restaurants either on the beachfront or the roadside. We visited the spa for the the maya signature massage and even went back again as it was so good.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Michelle S;Paradise undiscovered!;This is a very new hotel, so new that I am pretty sure that I was one of a handful of guests. It is centrally located on the beach walk in Sanur, where one can spend an afternoon walking or riding a rented bike ($4US for 2 hours) as I did. I stayed in a Deluxe Private Lagoon room and never saw another soul in the lagoon. Most nights I was the only person in the restaurant of my choice. Go soon as I am sure word is getting out. My room was very modern and comfortable with the largest bathtub I have ever seen. A walk out to the beach will give you fantastic ocean views from Reef restaurant or The Tree Bar.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;AnnaMichelleH;Loved it!!;I had one night at the Maya to do an industry review. The hotel is just having the finishing touches applied but it wasn't disturbing at all. The staff here were all incredible. So so friendly, knew my name from my room number and we're just lovely and completely unintrusive. The grounds around the main pool are gorgeous, food and drinks are very nice with reasonable prices. I absolutely loved my room. I was upgraded to a lagoon view but did inspect the other room types. All consistent in the styling and just a slight difference in size. My room was spacious, comfortable and had an understated elegance to it. Separate bath and shower (bath tub is huge!) and two vanities.;5;1;0;1;1;0;0

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Mark R;Eye Catching Design;The design of this hotel is amazing. Surely one of the most eye catching buildings in Bali. They haven't quite finished construction yet, but it should be completed in the next few weeks. The rooms are extremely comfortable and have all the amenities you could need. I loved the little charging station at one end of a bench seat in our room. A nice touch to keep all your electronics from cluttering your bedside table.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;Joanne M;Wonderful Staff!;"We spent a week at Maya Sanur, and whilst some small parts of the property are not complete this did not impact our stay in the ""deluxe lagoon access room"" which was a beautiful room.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;selena007;Wonderful Experience;We have stayed in this new hotel for 5 nights last week at the end of our 2-week holiday. The architecture is extraordinary and the rooms are absolutely stunning, modern and light-flooded. Great location directly on the beach.

Sanur Denpasar Bali;Maya Sanur Resort & Spa;FaXi73;Surreal experience of luxury on the beach;We were fortunate enough to stumble into this luxurious heaven while casually walking along the beach - during the softest of soft openings (we were the third guests). The setting is very stylish on a picturesque beach (which the infinity pool and the tree top bar take full advantage of) yet very relaxing. The rooms are beautifully designed with great attention to detail, the highlight being the daybed on the balcony or lagoon, depending on your room type.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0

The staff at this hotel are all exceptional and treated us like family! As a titanium Bonvoy member we were upgraded and no request was left unanswered. I would like to specifically say thank you to Khansa who went above and beyond! She emailed prior to our arrival to ensure we had everything that was needed for our first trip to Bali as well as KeKe! Between the two of them we had everything we needed .

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Renaye;Fantastic Hotel and Amazing Staff;This is my second time staying at this hotel and my first time back since the pandemic and this hotel did not disappoint. From the moment you walk in you are greeted by the most wonderful people who go above and beyond. The room is so clean and bed comfy, my only complaint is the fridge, it has no temperature setting and its the only time drinks have come out hotter than when they went in (same complaint as the first time I stayed there) for a 5 star hotel you expect a cold fridge. Food was amazing and breakfast choice was huge. Do yourself a favour and stay at this hotel, you will love it.;5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;pittsy66;A true 5 star experience;Absolutely loved our stay here. Firstly the room was great - spacious, super clean and great air con.

Overall, great stay.;5;0;1;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Scott A;On a scale of 1-5 stars, the Stones gets an 18!;Stones hotel is an amazing hotel well located in Bali. The room itself was clean, with a great view of the pool and ocean. Little details were thought out like having a hair dryer outlet, near the mirror, where needed. The bed was comfortable, pillows supportive and the shower was clean and had great water pressure. The pool was refreshing, food delicious and abundant. They had a great band playing, featuring a singer appropriately named Ayu (beautiful) It fit both her looks and her singing voice.;5;0;0;0;0;1;1

We had the tub in the balcony and definitely recommend! The breakfast is really good, always with gluten free options. Cocktail happy free hour daily as well.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Col R;The Stones - September 2022 - Great!;"We stayed here with around 7 other couples from Australia. Overall it is very good. Was part of a Jetstar package, so don't recall the pricing, but was good. I will give an honest review - Cons - the street frontage of the property has a slightly ""closed"" look. This is probably a post pandemic issue where the sweeping driveway/shopping mall area is sort of deserted. It is however clean and tidy. The pool music can be a little intrusive if you are seeking an afternoon nap in your room. There are a few minor issues related to the accuracy of the billing, however these are fixed without issue once identified. Pros - great location opposite the beach, no traffic noise as the rooms are set back. Amazing pool, huge, well maintained, perfect water.";5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ben M;Excellent;We stayed at the stones for 6 nights and could not fault any aspect of this hotel. The rooms were immaculate and clean. Wifi great.

The room was clean and the bathroom facilities modern. The bed was very comfortable. We have been to Bali many times and stayed in lots of hotels all over Bali but this hotel has the BEST breakfast ever! The choice is varied & vast, delicious & fresh, you would be hard pressed to find better! The pool is HUGE, pool area is kept clean and there are plenty of sunbeds with mattresses and cushions so these too are very comfortable. The lunch & dinner menus had lots to offer and was good quality. The only thing missing were robes in the;5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;JennySoegiarto;Great stay here...;Having the pool access pool room at this hotel is good but I still prefer the pool view with the outdoor bathtub which were fully booked at that time. But I really enjoyed my stay there. The room is clean and spacious. The bed is firm and pillow are nice. I love the freeform pool, made me really exercise swimming along the pool. The breakfast is just nice, great variety and live cooking is available and last but not least..everyone favorite is there... Instant noodle...!!! They serve dragon fruit juice which is very very nice... Location is perfect, walking distance to one of the best mall, Beach Walk. Surrounded by resto and minimart..;5;0;1;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Carrie L;Awesome;From the moment we arrived we were made very welcome. We had an amazing time on our 5 night stay. All the staff couldn’t help us enough. The 2 for 1 happy hour (12 to 6) by the pool was a hit. The room was very well presented and clean. Would stay again for sure. A special Thank You to Candra, Agus in the restaurant and Arik at pool bar. These 3 made our stay extra special going above and beyond to help us. 🙏;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Andreea E;A Wonderful Surprise;"My Family and I arrived here by accident. We were supposed to stay at another hotel in Nusa Dua, however we had to change those arrangements at the very last minute. We arrived at the Stones Hotel having booked our rooms just 2 hours prior to our arrival. The room was nice and spacious, always clean. The bathtub on the balcony was wonderful; we really loved it and used it every single night of our stay. The pool area is wonderful and very clean, water temperature was perfect! Breakfast is nice and diverse and the hotel restaurant is delightful. The location is great, few minutes walk from the shopping center and restaurants; right across the beach.";5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Alex O;Excellent Hotel That Does The Marriott Brand Justice;Not exactly sure what happened to the review I spent half an hour to write......but here goes nothing at my 2nd attempt. Location (8/10): The hotel is located right across Kuta Beach towards the end of Kuta Road. It's in a perfect spot close to both shopping and nightlife. Beachwalk Mall is about a 10 minute walk away and you can also walk north along the beach and reach the Seminyak area in about 20-25 minutes. The only downside I'd say is that Kuta Road gets pretty jammed so if you're headed back to the hotel at the end of the day of touring you'll get stuck in traffic. Aside from that we found it to be in a perfect location and far enough back from the road that it is really quiet and chill. Property (7/10);4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Jill D;Nice hotel for the younger crowd;We stayed at the stones for 4 nights as we got a good deal. The hotel itself is big, informal & impersonal. The rooms are very clean and well kept although this is the first hotel that offers slippers to its guests but no robes? The breakfast is great with a good variety of options and the staff go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The pool area is HUGE with a fabulous pool although there does appear to be a few maintenance issues with chipped & broken pool tiles, broken pool chairs and a few mouldy sunbed cushions. The music from the pool bar is suited to a younger crowd, it was very loud and not easy to relax & read for an older guest. I would say if you are aged approx 20's/30's then this is perfect for you.;3;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Steve Carlo;Just average;Stayed at stones at March 27-28. room with mini-pool, the mini-pool was good was a quick dip. It was clean. The room however is just standard. Maybe age is taking its toll. I stayed at courtyard Seminyak the night before.. Courtyards room is way better and cleaner, and cheaper too. By the way, a quick mention, even though we are only a silver marriot member. Courtyard got us a free room upgrade upon check in. Stones didn't give us any. Maybe the receptionist who checked us in is still trainee. The towel hanger is a bit rusty. The shower on/off is very slippery to turn on and off. Breakfast is just standard. However we loved the fresh banana smoothie.;3;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;robert soen;Another bad marriot collection;I stayed in this hotel 09-11 feb. In my oppinion, this hotel considers as 4 stars hotel than 5 stars hotel. I havent found any luxurious things impress me up . Room was not well clean, tidy and bad smells. The good thing i can say only the swimming pool. It was big and clean. Breakfast menu was OK . All staffs were nice to me and very helpfull. 2 days is enough to stay in this hotel. If u looking for a comfy and luxurious hotel this is not a good choice.;3;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;EllianaWong;First and gonna repeat for some more;Yummy breakfast The most important is comfy and CLEAN bed 😁😍 This is my first stay,but wont be my last...gonna come back later when visiting there Nice swimming pool, which kids gonna be having lots of fun.;5;0;0;0;0;1;1

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ryzha Cathria;Pleasant stay;First time stay at The Stones and decided to spend our last night here was a good choice. Our room got upgraded to Deluxe Corner thanks to Dewa/Duty Manager whom I contacted with during pre arrival. Room is so big with bathtub and two shower (first time I saw bathroom with two shower, that’s crazy). Hotel was quiet and not so many guest during my time there. Have some issues with hot water, water pressure and AC in our room but it’s not a big deal as we only stay for one night. Breakfast was good and the location of the hotel also nice, will definitely coming back here!;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Michelle E;Had a great time!;WoW! The best promo stay with only $40 nett or IDR 550K in one of the Marriott 5 star hotels “The Stones Legian” with breakfast included for 2 persons and we were upgraded to a beautiful Deluxe Room Pool View with the bathtub at the balcony. One of the most beautiful hotel we have visited. This was probably the 4th visit in this hotel. We had a great stay and a wonderful time at the pool. The cleanliness is good. The hotel itself I can say is truly magnificent and it’s like a hidden gem in Legian Bali. Beautiful hotel and the pool is huge with clear water. We don’t need to worry much as it’s still in the pandemic condition, but this hotel strictly complies the rules and has also the highest standard.;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;n7sm;Comfortable stay, pampered, would come back.;In short: Cleanliness: great. Fresh and clean towels every day. Fresh linen every 3 days. Room service twice a day. Pool: clean, spacious enough to accommodate a large crowd even during high occupancy periods. There's a roof top pool called the Secret Pool operating 5:30-7pm. Make use of this option to shot stunning photos up there. Food: divers scrumptious options at the breakfast buffet. Open from 6:30-11 am. Extensive options are available on the menu, and every day they offer a special of the day.;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Amy G;Great hotel;Been to Bali many times but first time at the stones. Pros - Beautiful hotel with a great pool. We never had a problem getting a lounge chair and they have signs every where staying that if you’re stuff is left on them unattended for 30 mins they will remove - short stroll to Legian or Kuta if you’re happy with walking and it’s right across from the beach - breakfast was amazing. The donuts are 10/10. So much variety. Fresh eggs, pancake station, donut wall, pastries, cheese, Fruit, ice cream + much more - security was great - all the food we had by the poolside was delicious. They have daily specials as well, just not advertised very well so may have to ask - my room was nice and clean. Great housekeeping - kids utilised the kids club most days so was great to get;4;0;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ree;6 Star Service;"First time to Bali so our trip was booked through an agent who suggested that The Stones Hotel would be central to what it was that we were looking for from our trip. We weren't disappointed. After our check-in we were shown to our ""pool view"" room which may not be considered 5 star by some as it was a little tired, but we were happy enough with it as it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. We had a large balcony and on that balcony we had a day bed and a nice deep bathtub which was fabulous. We enjoyed a daily buffet breakfast which had many selections to cater for everyone, from tradition";5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Mary L;Fantastic stay at The Stones;From check in until we were dropped at the airport for our flight home in a private car, our 9 night stay at The Stones was excellent. We are Bonvoy gold elite, so i'm not sure how much of our experiences were attributed to that, but i'm sure no matter what every guest is treated very well at this hotel. Upon check-in we received little drinks, and were processed through very quickly. Our room was a ground floor room with plunge pool - we did not find this any cooler than the main pool and spent plenty of time in there reading and relaxing. Room was very comfortable, bed was a proper king size. Room was clean and housekeeping was thorough every day of our stay. We had breakfast each day, and the food, service and atmosphere was excellent.;5;0;0;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;TreviAkld;One of the Best;Our second time staying at this Hotel as when you are onto a good thing don't go looking for better as this place is at the top. The staff are just excellent and so friendly, special thanks to Wawan for making us feel so much welcomed and his outlook on life is just inspirational, the pool and dining is great, perfect location with Garlic lane just around the corner and beach across the road. Well done The Stones keep it up we will be back, Also a special thanks to The Stones for making our 32nd Wedding Anniversary just an amazing experience. My only suggestion for the Stones is a departure lounge, this would just top it off, apart from that a big thank you from the two of us.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;KPD;Lovely Hotel;Stayed at the hotel the first week of September. Beautiful surroundings and great location. Definitely recommend and we will be back.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Lily Arden;A Comfortable Stay;beautiful pool setting, excellent buffet breakfast where they can make you smoothies on request, and comfortable room.

The pool is amazing, as well as the food and cocktail menu! The buffet breakfast is so worth including, such a massive variety. The gym is good too being 24 hours. Our room was clean, spacious and we were greeted to a welcome tray of honeycomb sweets as well as some cakes midway through our stay - lovely touch! Location is great, directly across the street from the beach, just around the corner from the hotel is an abundance of restaurants & shops and it’s not a far;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Lynden K;Great service, location and value without too many negatives;The obvious shortcoming with this resort is that it is not beachfront prime and set back via a rather desolate looking driveway of near 200 metres from Jalan Pantai Kuta. The other consideration is that the motorised and pedestrian traffic accessing the hotel is frenetic to say the least from the main road Jalan Pantai Kuta. The Stones well compensates with a massive family style resort pool furnished with abundance of luxurious thickly padded lounges. Breakfast offerings are predictable without being outstanding and would be easily enhanced with a fresh juice station like many of its competitors and some more local dishes. The location has its appeal with quick access to the beach and the nearby hustle and bustle.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Emily S;Amazing visit!;What an amazing hotel! It is about 15-30 min from the airport depending on traffic, complimentary pickup and return was included. The room was very clean with modern decor. Our room came with the pool view, it came with a bathtub on the balcony. It is a very safe hotel with security that checks every car that enters and scans patrons and their bags as well. Room service was great and prompt. The entire staff at the hotel is extraordinary. We felt very welcomed and appreciated the wonderful hospitality. Thank you Arie and Putra for going above and beyond for us! The gym had excellent equipment. The food, especially the breakfast, is a must. They also provided private driver services. What an excellent hotel in a great location. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others!;5;0;1;1;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;ReviewerEye;Good location in Kuta;It’s near most of busy area in Kuta. Walking distance to beach and bars.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;RobbofromPerth;Value and location;IMO ... this hotel is very comfortable and is ideal if you want to explore the local area but is also a haven to relax in when you're done. It is set back from the main road but easy walking access to Legian shops and restaurants and close to Beach Walk shopping center. The pool is nice with plenty of sun beds. Good restaurant and food and drink prices are reasonable for a hotel. Couples spa treatment was great.;4;1;1;0;0;0;0

I had a room with a pool but the water was really cold, so spent most of the time in the main pool. Room size was comfortable with great toilets and showers . Huge comfortable bed, cable Tv and great wifi. The breakfast buffet was huge with a diverse selection of food.;5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Tara M;My Favourite Place In Bali;I stayed here with my partner in April and I am so thankful that we did. Everything about this place is class and we had the most amazing relaxing stay here having been in Bali at other locations for 10 nights. On arrival our room was not quite ready so we were taken to the pool area for a complimentary drink and only had to wait a short time before our room was ready and we arrived to find our bags delivered and a beautiful room with a balcony bath awaiting us. The lay out is slightly awkward with the toilet and shower being the first thing you find on entering but other than that the rooms are perfect. Massive fluffy comfortable bed, good quality linen, big TV, great balcony with the bath, clothes horse and day bed. The Stones has hands down the very best breakfast I have ever;5;0;0;0;1;0;1

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;HelenK70;Great resort and pool!!!!;We stayed here for 9 nights in late March 2019. It was a lovely resort in a good location. You enter into the hotel down a long driveway so the hotel is not on the Main Street making it quieter. Very good security so you always felt safe. Buffet breakfast had plenty of choice and we just loved the ‘doughnut wall’!!! Staff at the front desk were very helpful and polite. The pool is wonderful, plenty of space to swim around in without feeling like you are on top of people. Giant pool pillows to float around on and relax. The staff at the pool bar are so friendly but a special mention must go to Wahyu. Wahyu always came straight over to see us once we arrived at the pool and brought over our drinks and food quickly. Nothing was too much trouble for Wahyu who was extremely polite;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Special thanks to Derry and Fajar who both went above and beyond to help us out during the difficult and stressful time. I can't fault their customer service, exemplary customer service.

It was sooo good!! The restaurant was amazing overall, we ate there almost all the time. Drinks at the bar are great too.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Shalini;Good stay;Stayed there for three days. Overall it was a good stay. Breakfast was ok, could be improved. Location is excellent. Near to beach and walking distance to main street, bike rentals, tour company and mart. Room was smaller than image in the website. Nevertheless, a good stay.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;A_Jaye;Great Location and Cost;I enjoyed my stay at The Stones Hotel in Bali. While I wasn't a huge fan of Kuta, the hotel property is in the perfect location. You are right next to all the nightlife and a 2 minute walk from the beach. Given the traffic situation in Bali, not having to take taxis everyone was a serious time saver.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Lejada;Amazing hotel... Great location;I’ve travelled to Bali 12 times and this place was perfect in so many ways..

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Shweta N;Fun Pool;And its definately the pool that won hands down ...the floating cushions are so inviting that oldest of guest cant resist getting on them ....having said that ..after the initial disappointment of being given the room which was a miles walk and getting it changed ..we settled in ...the hotel is up to the standards of a 5 star ...the breakfast was good ..the only minus point is the location ....its a long walk to reach the shopping street ..or u need to take a cab which has a minimum cost...;3;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Nadia;Excellent place to stay;Stayed here for 5 days and 4 nights. Was able to relax and rejuvenate. The pool was very clean and was able to find a lounge chair to relax in by the pool. You are able to walk or get a taxi easily. Will stay here again.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Hari S;Honeymoon in Indonesia;Travelled to Bali in February of this year for our honeymoon. I was in awe with the property since i stepped in. The check in formalities were smooth and we were excited about the next five days we are going to spend there. The service team was very prompt. There was a tiny glitch with the air condition and when reported was attended to immediately. Overall we enjoyed the time spent in the property. The breakfast was delicious with an expansive spread, the swimming pool was awesome, The location is ideal, as it is only a walkable distance to the nearby commercial district of Kuta. On our return, we had decided we would be visiting the property again.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Col B;Great place;What a great place for a relaxing break. Greeted by very attentive staff and made to feel more than welcome. Our deluxe room overlooking the pool was comfortable and clean, a bathtub on our balcony and an extremely comfortable king size bed. Room service was top notch and if you needed anything it was there in a flash. The staff are amazing friendly people. The restaurant- whether it was breakfast lunch or dinner was top shelf ! The food was amazing and plenty of it with a great variety for all tastes. The restaurant staff were also very attentive and polite. The swimming pool is amazing! Clean , huge, and if you get out early the private bure’s are awesome to just lay about and relax. There’s even a nice warm spa. You can swim up to the pool bar or just push your buzzer.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;760PeterA;Great hotel but too noisy with music;I loved the hotel. But the music is too loud at the pool and at the restaurant. This effects all rooms facing the pool. Rooms are pricy when no specials. But a lovely hotel. Food is good. Rooms are clean. Beach near by and clean and nice. It’s very central to everything. My only problem was the loud music which could be heard inside room with doors closed. I expected a five star hotel to be quieter. Catering for older generation.;4;0;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Jackie G;Great value and exceptional service;I was in Indonesia for work and my husband and I had 5 extra days to chill. I looked at Literally hundreds of hotels but came across The Stones and booked it. Great decision. The location is fabulous. A stones throw from the beach and lots of restaurants. A 10 minute walk from shopping. Room was comfortable and had all amenities. The pool is huge and very relaxing. We ate on the property most nights and the food was great. I thing was too much trouble. We will definitely return. Loved our stay in this top quality resort.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;anneogalex;Very good;This hotel was really good. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The roms are big and clean. The restaurant was nice and served good food. The pool was nice, and they were doing renovations to make it even better. The pool and reaturant by the beach was in need of a face lift and was very shabby. But a great hotel and it is very close to shopps and restaurants.;5;0;1;1;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Aussie_A_Family;25th Wedding Anniversary Holiday!;The staff at the hotel were so friendly and attentive. The location was perfect...on the edge of Kuta and the start of Legian, just across from the beach but well set back from the street, so no noise or disturbances at all. It was so quiet. The security at the hotel was amazing, screening every time you enter the hotel like at the airport. Multiple guards. Felt very safe. I chose the hotel because of the pool and I was not disappointed...it has the biggest pool! The pool bar, food, cocktails and service were fantastic.The breakfasts were amazing. A really relaxing holiday!;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Lenzylamb;Great Stay!;This was a nice little retreat in the middle of a very busy town. We utilized the spa multiple times and enjoyed each and every treatment. Room was clean, pool view was great and internet was really fast. Restaurant was good but menu got old after almost a week. Word of advice head down to the pool early. If you don’t have a seat by 10 am, good luck.;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;LouizeRose;Brilliant first time visit;Location of this hotel is great. Far enough away from Kuta, but still close to the beach and market shopping etc. The pool and cocktails are wonderful. The room with a bath on the balcony was superb. Never had a better buffet breakfast. Faultless stay!;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Mmalting;Good value **;I booked 2 rooms for 5 nights through booking.com at a very affordable price. The rooms are nice, could do with a Good scrub on the shower and toilet doors but otherwise clean. Lovely open spacious room. I booked the standard king room in which they do not allow an extra bed for a child over the age of 2 in. You are expected to share the existing bedding with your child up until the age of 12!!! I bought a $9 blow up mattress and he got just fine in the room. The atmosphere around the pool area is great with music and a dj later on in the day. The ground def need some maintenance as the boards around the pool are lifting and dangerous.;4;1;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Charlie S;Excellent!;We stayed here for just over a week. The breakfast was brilliant with a really wide choice. Drinks and food during the day were priced reasonably for hotel prices and were of a good standard. Especially liked the happy hours and music which came on at 3 o'clock around the pool. Unfortunately we stayed in Bali during the Lombok earthquake. Once we had enquired at asked for advice and information on what was happening, we were met by the General Manager who was well informed and put us at ease in relation to the situation. We would definitely recommend this hotel, the location is around 15 minute walk from the nightlife and 5 minutes away from a shopping centre and wide range of restaurants along Kuta;5;1;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Gabrielko1967;Great Hotel;We spent one week at this hotel. Very clean and very safe. Breakfast offers a large variety and delicious meals. Rooms are impeccable clean. Best is to get a room with pool view. The hotel is away from the beach (no view) but they have few restaurants at the entrance. At the top level restaurant, you have tables with infinity pools, where you can enjoy a dinner and a drink and then swim in your private infinity pool. We have observed an amazing sunset from this pool. We would recommend using this hotel for your trips.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;iyke187;Very good hotel for a short stay;I was here for two nights during my visit to Bali last month. What I like about the hotel is the location. The hotel is very close to the beach and a few minutes walk to the shopping mall. My only complain is the hotel housekeeping. Why have housekeepers that intentionally ignore visible dirty spots on the room ceiling and green mold in the bathroom shower head.;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Tani B;Great staff, grounds and atmosphere at The Stones;. We booked for 4 nights and found location of this hotel to be the only down side which is a very minor issue in terms of only being able to access the hotel via the one way main road which is full of traffic during the day. The location is excellent if you want access to Kuta beach. The positives - Excellent rooms other than slow draining bathroom sinks in 2 of our 4 rooms. Each room has its own bath tub on the balcony unless you are in a connecting room. I would highly recommend upgrading to a suite for a small price - it makes all the difference especially if you have a small child with you. Breakfast is a delightful mix of lots of cuisines and the;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Paul L;Great Place;Nice place to stay in Bali, good facilities , is a little bit noisy but I thinks that is not the resort fault , is more about the clients...

I will definitely go back.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Jonjay24;Honeymoon;Great hotel, we stayed in a few hotels during our honeymoon and this was one of our favourites. Probably slightly on the expensive side when you upgrade the room but no complaints. Room was spacious, only issue with the room was ours was on the ground floor and people passing the room outside on the mornings were loud and disturbed our sleep. Location was perfect, the beach right across the road and the main strip of bars and restaurants was a five minute walk away.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Jodenie;Great hotel in front Kuta Beach;Amazing hotel with big swimming pool decoration by coloring light. the hotel facilities especially Gym equipment were fantastic, location near to Beach walk, shopping area, restaurants.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;BeeTPiont;Good;All in all this is a good hotel, location is good in the far pace Kuta! Rooms are clean and semi equipped. No mini bar for a five star hotel is different, bathroom at the entrance is different but you get used to it. Just missing the five star x-factor. I 100% recommend Stones Hotel and it is affordable. The staff make up for its short comings. Well done to whoever trains the staff as they amongst the most friendly I’ve come across!;4;1;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;mbell141080;Best place to stay in Bali.;Where do you start with a place like this, from the moment you enter all the way up to when you leave everything is fantastic. The location of this place we thought was great, right across from the beach and only a short walk to Kuta or anything you need. The rooms are beautiful and well maintained. We had our own personal pool right across from the main pool. There is nothing bad I can say about this place and definitely will be back. So to front of house, food & beverage, porters, housekeeping and security teams, thankyou for making our stay so enjoyable.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Infideon;Not too bad for the price;Well as a solo trip for some me time I chose this hotel as it was by Marriott and was near the beach. Hotel is clean and spacious though I would have appreciated a better facing room. Bali was extremely hot in March but the hotel had a great pool decent restaurant with a good spread of breakfast Room was again clean and not much complains. Gym was good and underutilized as expected but had a few good workouts here. I prefer seminyak still and would prob stay back there the next time I visit bali again.;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;cuteelephant;VERY nice;I stayed 3 nights with my family, includes 7monthsold baby. Very nice, staff were so polite and very helpfull. They gave us popsicle frutty as welcome ‘ice’ drink. Nice for a hot day. We stayed in deluxe corner room, spacious room enough to add 1 extra bed and has a bath tub. Clean enough, nice bed, soft bedcover and cool AC. Nice swimming pool, specially the big pillow floating, my boy can play on the pillow in the pool, and very nice breakfast, not much choices but the taste was very good. They even have gelato😋. Great value for what you get with the room price. The minus is the location, sorry, Legian especially in front of Kuta beach, is very, like VERY crowded and heavy traffic jam specially during weekend. But if the hotel was nive enough, like this one, than just;5;1;0;1;1;1;1

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;saleh3aro;Great Hotel;The hotel itself is great, rooms and facilities including kids club and swimming pool really fantastic. The location is a little bit far from the live area in kuta beside this and other hotels in bali isn't in the beach direct, it's a little bit far frim the beach. The security process also a higg level nearly to be mode than acceptable without a reason, but it's still good. Overall, it's a great hotel, I love it.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Paige S;Stunning Hotel Truly Five Star;The pool is honestly my favourite feature. Of an afternoon around happy hour a DJ would play by the pool, and there was good selection of cheap cocktails. However the gym was also great, and very clean. The restaurant had a large selection of meals. And the customer service was excellent. I would 100% go back, this was my favourite hotel we booked over our holiday.;5;1;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Travis P;Great hotel!;This is a great hotel. Once you enter, it is very beautiful, clean. I’ve stayed here a couple of times for business and each time, they remember me. The breakfast buffet is one of the best I’ve had in all my stays around the world. In fact, lunch and dinner are pretty good too. With a short walk out the front gates, you are on the beach and just hang two lefts with a few more minute walk, you are on the main street with shops and restaurants. Also, the main shopping center is just around the corner too. This is one of my top stays in Bali and I would recommend it.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Agus F;Fully Recommended Hotel in Kuta;This is my second time stay here. Just like my previous stay, no complaints at all. Im very happy to stayed in here. As a Marriot’s member, I got 50% discount for Breakfasts. Breakfasts food are very good. Best Pastry The pool and location are perfect. Room very clean and spacious, I recommend to book deluxe room with pool view. I can’t wait to be back in the future. Each unit had 5 stars hotel standards and meet my expectation.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;mark o;Fantastic stay;This review is a bit late but well worth writing about. Our family stayed at the Stones Hotel in early December 2017 for 9 days and we absolutely loved it. My son recommended it to us as he stayed there in Feb. The resort was so clean and the pool was fantastic. All the staff were very friendly and always helpful. A special thankyou to Wawan in the pool area - he was great, always looked after us with drinks, food and towels. His customer service was fantastic which made our stay even better. The rooms were so clean and the buffet breakfast was amazing. A special thankyou to Sutarma who went out of his way every morning to make us fresh squeezed juices, which he recommended. He was also nice enough to give me a copy of the ingredients he used so I could make;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Marisa R;Great Stay;Stayed here for 5 nights and had the most amazing time. Would only recommend getting a room that faces the pool and has the balcony with a bathtub as the view is one of the best bits. Awesome pool, convenient location and the buffet breakfast had lots of variety. Very friendly staff, especially Wawan at the poolside bar who was always happy to have a chat and offer up some great recommendations for restaurants, spas and things to do so we would like to thank him especially. Definitely not the cheapest hotel in the Kuta/Legian area but I definitely think the extra cost is worth it.;5;1;1;1;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Vanessa P;Location, Luxury, Service;This Hotel is amazing! It is 5 star by far. The location is great, you are over the road from the beach, you are near the markets and fancy new shopping center (few minutes walk) yet you are out of the hustle and bustle. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive. You are always greeted with a smile. The security at the hotel is top notch, you certainly feel very safe. The food at the restaurant is amazing - the breakfast has everything you could think of including ice cream! The Indonesian buffet and the Seafood & Jazz dinner nights are a must! The bar has a great selection of cocktails and 2 x happy hours per day. There is a swim up bar, and the pool loungers are in the water! There are hammocks in the trees too for those wanting to really relax. The rooms are lovely and;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;_susan_dysart;Lovely hotel. Upgrade to pool view for sure!;Really enjoyed this lovely hotel. Started in a deluxe room, which was ok but chose to upgrade to the pool view , which has a bath on the balcony, and it was totally worth the upgrade. Comfy beds and pillows, buffet breakfast is excellent with a huge selection. Location is good too , across from beach although the swimming pool is fantastic. About 8-10 min Walk to Beachwalk shopping centre;5;0;1;0;0;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;MigueLatorre;Excellent !!;"We stayed 3 nights at The Stones and everything was just perfect. I have stayed in many hotels in Bali and The Stones is definitely one of my favourites! Great location (1min walk to the beach), amazing pool area, nice room. Perhaps the only thing to improve is the breakfast, as I found it a bit below expected; however, the quality of the food was very good. I will definitely come back here in my next trip to Bali.";5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Cn T;Superb!;I'm impressed with this place I stayed for 2 nights. The ambience, the people, the set up were of tip top. What's worth mentioning here was the tight security at the entrance of the hotel as compare to hotels around kuta. This was because our group stayed in 3 different hotels in kuta. The only complaint I have was the room floor. They tiled up the floor and I felt a little sticky on the floor as there was not carpeted. Or it's just the way the clean it. Mr Gede, the gentleman taking care of the clients at the lobby is someone I wanted to praise. He took the trouble to make sure all my Uber drivers would pick me up right at the lobby as there was always confusion with the drivers on the pick up point. Thank you Mr Gede.;5;1;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ruby K;My second stay here...;"First and foremost: what I like the most about this hotel is the large pool and swim up bar - perfect place to relax. Our room was clean and had everything we needed here: hairdryer, iron, and bathroom amenities large king bed and fluffy pillows. Buffet breakfast offers a very wide variety and I like the sign ""its never to early to eat ice cream!!' I read on here that there is a roof top bar - wish we had known as we went to other hotels with roof top bars to watch the sunset - would of been perfect to stay here during sunset - next time!!!";5;0;0;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Melissa O;Our Third Stay!;Best breakfast,. coolest pool! Recommend the rooms with a bath on the balcony.

The drinks are a little bit pricey , the pool side menu was really nice food We didn’t have breakfast or airport transfers included in our price which was disappointing . It’s in a great location so close to Melasti street shopping and a short walk to Kuta . Right across from the beach . Very safe hotel to stay in .;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;LWhorlow;Amazing hotel;One of the best hotel we ever stayed, from their reception, their rooms are very clean, simple designs yet looks elegant, bed and pillows are so comfortable, the swimming pool looks so inviting, I love their hammock part of the resorts, so relaxing. Their breakfast buffet is excellent, being a fresh juice lover, I love the fact that you can order your own mixtures of fruit and veggies juice, my husband loves the pool bar, well done barman. It is highly recommended, location is spot on, beach is just across the road, it is near the shopping malls, souvenir shops and restaurants.;5;0;1;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Mrskussy;Superb - couldn't fault it;Arrived at 1am and the check in was swift and efficient. Beds and pillows super comfy. Room overlooking the pool and small Day bed on the balcony was lovely. Breakfast was incredible - one of the better spreads we have had in 12 trips. The massage by Dewi at the Celestine spa was AMAZING. We are glad it wasn't school holidays though as screaming kids in the huge pool (which was super sparkling clean by the way) would have spoilt the experience as the rooms and restaurant centre around the pool. The gardens - gorgeous too. Will be back next visit to this hotel for sure.;5;0;0;0;0;1;1

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Rob R;Great Hotel & Great location;The hotel is in a great location, and very quiet. The rooms are nice, perfect size with everything you need. The common areas are clean and very nice. Breakfast buffet was good and had something healthy to choose daily. I would suggest not having a room with a private pool. We moved after 3 days it was not practical to relax and it is covered with no sun exposure. Traffic is really bad and it is a one way street. I suggest renting beach cruisers from bali bike hire. They will deliver and pick up the bikes. Perfect for riding on the boardwalk near the beach to all the restaurants and the beaches. balibikehire.com. We highly recommend for a short stay or 3 weeks as we did.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

We checked in at around midnight and when we arrived they had upgraded as from a premium pool room to a deluxe pool room. At first we were quite upset as we originally wanted the premium pool room as this is what we come to this hotel for. After speaking to the supervisor that night they stated that they couldn't offer this to us as the hotel was fully booked.;4;0;0;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;MoulieMum2015;Enjoyable stay at The Stones;The Stones was a quite oasis amongst the hustle and bustle of Kuta. We loved the pool, fabulous breakfasts and the friendly staff. We stayed in a balcony pool view room and found the room clean and comfortable with a lovely large balcony. As previous reviewers have mentioned the room design is a little odd as you walk straight into the bathroom. We also would have liked a few USB points in the room to charge our multiple devices.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Kimmy D;Top service;The Stones was our last hotel that my friend and I stayed at and it was a great way to end our trip. We had a clean room with a king bed and a bath tub on our balcony that over looked the big pool. The selection of food at the buffet was insane. There was a variety of cultural food to suit everyone's taste and a pastry/cheese selection that would get you coming back for seconds. We loved that the hotel provided hammocks and a dj that played house music every afternoon.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ravi A;Good location, Ample Luxury & a nice pool;We stayed at this property in January this year. It was a great experience. The entrance lobby is very lavish & it's a great feeling entering the place. The room are luxurious and the staff very courteous which is what you expect from any good 5* property. The location makes this property stand out. It's almost on the beach. I loved the swimming pool. It's huge and pool bar with nice submerged bar stools to sit and have a beer.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Robert H;Great service;Had lunch here a few times. Lovely hotel, really well kept. I enjoyed eating lunch on the roof top. Sounded like they liked a late party so be careful of you like a peaceful nights sleep. Great location.;5;0;0;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Rahul Agarwal;Excellent location !!;Superb hotel with large banquet and conference facilities. The location is perfect and bang on the main street.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;beevoc;Classy;Enjoyed a 7 night stay, can't fault this hotel From rooms to pool area to food to location it ticks all the boxe Situated across the road from the beach provides easy twilight beach stroll Easy walk to Kuta or Legian shopping or $3-$5 taxi to Seminyak restaurants;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Lulufluff;Very nice;We stayed here for 2 nights to treat ourselves to 5 star. When you enter the hotel you always have to put your bags through a scanner and you walk through one like at the airports. The rooms were nice and clean. The pool is huge so it never seems crowded. If you want that Balinese feel this isn't the place for you. It doesn't have the huge Balinese gardens.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Terry C;A must read... outstanding resort.....;Truth is, I've never been a huge lover of Bali, that is until now. My last visit was in 2011 and have recently come back from a 9 day break with my wife at The Stones and wow did it deliver. From arriving at the lobby we were greeted with a 5 Star welcome, not to mention the real fruit icicle on arrival.. The rooms are very clean and the beds are one the most comfortable I've slept in at a hotel. We open the blinds and there we have our own private plunge pool.;5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Amanda F;Loved it!;Will definatlely return! Beautiful food and exceptional service! The team there made sure they go out of their way to ensure everything is done over and above. Location is great as well, across the road from the beach, in the middle of everything but seems so secluded. Loved it!;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Cheryl M;Perfect honeymoon;We honeymooned here in May 2014. Location was perfect and easy to get to the action and the resort is so well appointed that if we did not leave at all that would have been fine, too. The food at the hotel is sooo good, we really took advantage of the breakfast buffet and poolside dining. The pool is immaculate and the gym as well, with lots of machines and weights to choose from. The only thing I would have wanted would be for the dip pool connected to our room to be warmer.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Mav;Fantastic;We just got home after staying ten nights at the Stones. Had a great time. We chose to go with a room with a plunge pool and it was awesome, extremely relaxing and the room was clean and modern with a very comfortable bed. Over all the hotel was excellent, clean and had great security. The only negative were the bar drink prices which were like 17 dollars aus a cocktail but you can bring your own drinks in.The food was reasonably priced. My wife and I will be staying again.;5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Belinda G;Young but Tired;Stayed in this hotel for a week in February. This is part of the Marriot chain, and I was expecting big things. For a Hotel that is only 4 1/2 years old, it is a bit tired. Happy hour 3-6pm, 2 for 1 cocktails. Cocktails were small and average (watered down) Cocktails out of happy hour were no different. Only 3 pool seats at bar, not good for such a large pool. Location great, central and walking distance to all shopping. Daughter stayed at the Marriot Courtyard in Seminyak. Rooms were great, but pool smaller. Cocktails were nice too. Sorry but Bali is all about the cocktails in the Pool. (Not to mention my daughter paid half the price that we did).;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;candymum;Second Stay As Amazing as The First;outstanding breakfast ,clean well stocked rooms ,beds are so comfy ,asked for extra pillows ,blanket,and bigger coffee mugs upon check in,these arrived at the room seconds after we did ,Sparkling clean pool, If l had one complaint it would be the music out of the 7 days we were there the same music disc was played 5 times by the male DJ we knew what song was next variety would be nice mix of old and new not all thump thump music as there is a wide age group around the pool area , Can wait to come back at least we will know the music LOL.;5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Pgirl1771;Nice stay;Stayed at a deluxe pool view room which was very clean. The pool is big and the swim-up-to bar is nice as well. Can most definitely recommend the hotels breakfast - the buffet offers a wide variety of food for all kind of preferences and likes. You can choose which fresh fruit juice you would like or ask for a mix among many fresh fruits, definitely a huge thumbs up for that! Also the hotel is right across the street from the beach. Not so nice and dirty but waves are perfect if you love to surf or want to learn. If you like shopping there is a big shopping mall with many international brand shops 500m away (beach walk mall) I prefer Balis cultural sight and magical nature so was definitely not;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;DIxiehollins;Above Marriott Standards;1After only 2 days of a 7 day visit the staff I came into contact with addressed me by my name! I give the staff 100% for their gracious on the spot service. Front Desk was generous to offer me an upgraded room. My breakfast buffet each morning was simply awesome with approx 150 distinct items to choose from. The pool staff are phenonimal attentive to the needs of all pool goers. I enjoyed my clean room and the fluffy towels provided. The location is excellent. Highly recommended;5;0;1;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ketut Maraditya;Impressive!;Everything was excellent!! The room was spacious. The pool also huge. Breakfast and dinner was fantastic as well.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;alan_brett;Family Holiday;The service was fantastic. The breakfast buffet was amazing. We had barrister coffee, as much as you liked during breakfast. They had gluten free breakfast available. The location was good, only a short walk to markets or to the Beachwalk mall. We had deluxe pool view rooms which were fantastic, clean, maintained well and spacious. The pool was lovely and we could always find seats and umberellas.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Scott M;Second visit, still good.;We have just spent 9 days at the Sones Resort Legian. This is our second stay at the Stones following stays at The Courtyard in Seminyak and a Villa in Seminyak. We chose Stones again as the pool area is sensational, including the swim up bar, well equipped rooms and good in-house food options. The only down side to the Stones is its location. Although it is directly opposite the beach and close to Kuta shopping, traveling to most of the good restaurants in Seminyak , Kerobokan and Jimbaran is a bit of a hassle. The reason being the access road to the Stones which runs along the beach is one way...this means travel to other destinations is fine but the return journey is quite convoluted. The Director of F&B at the resort told me the conversion to a two way road was imminent and;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;inbston13;Vacation;Fabulous time at the Stones! Staff and location was wonderful. The location was perfect...close to the beaches, entertainment and shopping. Perfect location for walking... no need for taxis or other mode of transportation. The hotel restaurant both for breakfast and dinner is wonderful but local restaurants should be experienced also to enjoy the local foods and people's. Thanks for the memories. We plan to return asap.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Jessica B;A lovely hotel with a fantastic pool;This hotel is fantastic and the staff go above and beyond for you. When we first checked in we had paid for a deluxe room when we got to the room it was dirty and faced nothing with no balcony, was quite disappointed for the amount of money we had paid, spoke to staff and they were extremely apologetic and moved us straight away to a deluxe room with a balcony and bath overlooking the pool. The rooms are spacious and the bed is very comfortable. The pool is beautiful and has a hot jacuzzi which was nice as you don't often see these in Bali. We had a massage at the spa which was fantastic. The breakfast was the biggest buffet breakfast I had ever seen and the food was delicious with so much variety ! Location of the hotel is great and so is security. Cons: Not the hotels fault;4;0;1;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Paul F;Nice place but not for young families.;We have 2 boys aged 6 & 9 and choose this place because of the great reviews, the kids club, its central location and the photos looked amazing! The photos you see on the net don't do the place any justice, you need to see it in person to appreciate it! Location is fantastic with an easy walk to everything. Breakfast spread is great and plenty to choose from, if you're not satisfied here then you will be hard to please. Kids club situation was surprising however. We were advised that there kids could stay for a minimum of 3 hours per day and any longer they would be charged at a rate of RP100k per hour which is about $AU10. I vee stayed at a number of resorts with kids clubs and this is the first time I have ever come across charges and it is mentioned nowhere on any;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ranjith G;Very Good Hotel;Good Central Location. Beach Walk Shopping Mall is walking distance. Beach in front of the Hotel was disappointingly dirty. Room that we got must be one of the worst as it was on the ground floor and facing away from the Pool and there was no view whatsoever - then I made the mistake of not making a request for a room on a upper floor and with a view! Anyone visiting should request for a room on a higher floor facing the swimming pool side.;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Michael S;Very classy and great breakfast;Room on 4th floor overlooking pool. Balcony with bath and curtains for privacy. Very clean and modern. Enter unit into bathroom which was a bit strange but seemed to work well. Staff very good and very polite. Any request responded too very quickly. Main restaurant proved a great buffet breakfast that was included in the package. Great range of food for all naturalities and lots of it.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;MLBMelbourne;Swish!;The Stones is a great value for money resort close to all that Kuta/Legian has to offer. As good as many of the resorts that cost I'm 2 or 3 times the price. The breakfast buffet is excellent, the staff friendly, the rooms are immaculately clean, well appointed. I would highly recommend staying at at The Stones.;5;1;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Дмитрий;Place to relax;We stayed at this hotel just for a 5 days and we were suprised. The rooms are cleaned and teasty breakfast . The beach across the road. A lot of shops and cafes nearby. We spent really a good time!;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Richard F;Excellent staff;Along with other family, we stayed here for one week in November 2016. The hotel is nicely appointed. We were in a suite, which was nice-sized. Other family were in pool-view deluxe rooms, which were a little on the small side. The pool is very large and was not very crowded when we were there. The swim-up pool bar was a nice feature. We really enjoyed our stay. The location of the hotel is very convenient to getting around Bali. The breakfast buffet was amazing, certainly the largest array of food of all kinds that we have ever had.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Bandasea;Excellent Stay;We stayed for 3 nights at the end of our trip. Everything from check in to breakfast, to being able to use the pool facilities to shower before our late night flight was perfect. We were greeted with popsicles and towels at check in. A very smooth and easy check in process. There is a security station (as with most, if not all, hotels in Kuta/Legian area). A bank and ATM are located just outside the hotel, before the street, along with a gift shop, a surf school and a small canvas art shop. Bottled water replaced in our room, at times twice a day. The rooms are clean. The pool is large and while relatively busy during our stay, there was more than enough space for each group to have some privacy.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Unsungheroz;Love at a first stay;First time visiting Bali and stayed at The Stones Hotel was a memorable experience. The location near the beach, at one of the busiest street at Kuta really make the hotel the best option to stay in Bali.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Tash D;Its a 4 star hotel;This is a nice hotel (not luxury) We stayed for 7 nights (which I felt was too long for the room size and location) Location: across from beach, BUT 10-15 min walk to warungs (small Balinese restaurants) shopping. Its on a one way street, so getting a cab leaving the hotel is easy and good traffic, getting back is a nightmare - so much traffic, up to an hour longer. Its extremely hot for toddlers to be walking from 11am to 4pm, so easy taxi access is vital during these hours. Due to this, I wont be staying there again. Rooms: They are nice, BUT: too small, only comfortable for a petite size couple. In the end I was given a large corner deluxe room which was good for 2 adults and a toddler. The pool view rooms are small too, but do have a balcony.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;shylowinspear1;Outstanding service, food, rooms, pool... its all great!;Just got back and wow, love this hotel. Its amazing in so many ways. Rooms: we had interconnecting rooms, while not overlooking the pool and had no real view to speak of were great. super comfy bed and linen, lovely bathrooms. Cant fault the rooms at all. Really happy. Pool: fantastic. Loved the cabana's. Pool quite warm and very clean. The sun lounges are in the pool too which was great! Its huge too so plenty of room for everyone! Food: FANTASTIC. Loved it all, we ate in most days as it was so good. The breakfast buffet is something out of this world. It even has ice-cream and nutella donuts! My kids were in heaven. The Satay on lunch/dinner menu was the best I've ever had. The options and presentation was amazing. Spa: wow. Its pure bliss.;5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Perseus2324;Good modern & stylish hotel in Legian beach;Stayed 2 nights with my wife in April 2014 for a seminar at the hotel.

The lobby area was big and open aired.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Kevin P;Great Choice;Not much to say but worth the stay...good value, great staff and comfortable clean rooms. The pool is everything you would expect from a high end hotel in Bali. The location could not be better, however for first timers make sure you don't walk off the main streets at night. Taxis after dark are a good choice.;5;1;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Christie2175;Beautiful resort;Great resort. Stayed for four nights and it was very impressive. Great location in Legian. The food would have to be the best I have eaten in any resort we have stayed in, in Bali. Seafood buffet dinner was out of this world. Very classy hotel. Rooms quite spacious. I would have liked to have had pool view but we needed interconnecting rooms and I think that is all they had available. Had 2 children aged 10 and 12 and they loved it!! I would say the hotel had a boutique feel and was quiet around the pool with a chill out vibe!!! I would stay there again.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;candymum;LOVED LOVED LOVED the Stones An OASIS amongst the chaos !!!!!!;Have just had five amazing nights at the stones ,the pool is amazing the beds are so comfy. Fast internet loved that once you sign in your device that was it for your stay . We had a twin room pool view high floor. My only complaint is that twin rooms do not have the bath on the balcony and a love a good bath . it would also be useful to have someway to let the pool bar staff know you would like a drink or food around the pool ,other hotel have flags you stand up as this is one big pool area .Staff were amazing room always cleaned early so quite we will defiantly be back .;5;0;0;1;1;1;1

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;JunnWB;Good hotel;I checked out the previous hotel and move to The Stones for cleanliness and I wasn't disappointed. I booked the room on the very morning I checked in. The room is clean and so is the whole property. I brought my wife and a 4 month baby with me and requested for King Bed room but was only given a twin, hence the sleep for both of us are quite bad as one of us has to squeeze with baby at night to sleep. We requested to pay for upgrade of category to any room with King Bed upon check in and was told there isn't any room. Front desk suggested to let us know when there is King Bed available but was told only to have it on the last night out of the 3 nights we are staying there, so we declined to move. Didn't use the pool as baby was having flu but realized that there is;4;0;0;0;0;1;1

The hotel is in the walking distance of resturants, shops, the discovery mall and pretty much everything. ATM in the hotel erea. Security: The hotel has an advanced security system. When we first arrived they searched our cab( everytime you enter by car ). Everytime you enter the hotel you have to walk trough a metal detector, and send your handbags trough a seperate scanner. General: We were welcomed with iced tea which was very refreshing after our 19h flight here. The lady behind the desk was very friendly and checked us in with a smile. The hotel itself is so beautiful! Room: Our room was bright, modern and spaceous. Comfortable beds.;4;0;1;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Pottswood;Luxury with great service;My Wife and I and our 2 boys (12 & 6) stayed here for 6 nights at the start of July in inter-connecting rooms. After 2 weeks in a villa prior to being here we were looking for some luxury and that's exactly what we got. Rooms were spacious and extremely clean. Resort was beautiful and the kids loved the pool especially the daily complimentary mini refreshments offered (delivered by row boat). All the staff were fantastic and more than willing to help us with any request. A special mention to the head chef who would mingle with the crowd during dinner service to make sure everything was up to scratch. He even had a special meal made for our 6 year old when he didn't fancy the Indonesian themed dinner we attended.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;engineer2207;👍👍 hotel;Hotel is world class standard. Room was clean, friendly staff, nice surrounding. Very strategic to beach.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Per;Good spot to stay;The area is nice and there decent security measures. The area has a wonderful pool and the bar beside it is also nice but a bit pricey. Tasty cocktails and smoothies. Note that the prices they give you are before taxes and service charges. So everything is about 25% more than it says in the menu. The restaurant has some good food. I would specially recommend the Indonesian buffet served on Fridays. The chef was available to explain about the different courses made. The whole buffet has a lot of taste. A minus with the restaurant is the breakfast. It really chaotic and too small to handle the amount of guests. The selection though consists of a good 5 star breakfast buffet. Rooms are spacious and I was satisfied with the cleanliness.;4;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Wandering Giraffe;Good location, just cross to get to the beach;Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and they even gave me a one night free upgrade!

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Michael N;Spotless, modern and very polite service;I have to say, I was very surprised with the stones. The condition is immaculate, I loved the main reception area and our hotel room was spotless. I even left money out (by accident) and the trustworthy cleaners didn't even touch it! We stayed here for 7 nights and checked in at 2am with no problems, they even greeted us with ice lollies as it was mega hot that night! Breakfast had a great selection where you could have fresh fruit juice made in your face! Was such a pleasure staying here, I would do so again. My only negative feedback is the location because it's a walk from the main area, however at the same time it's away from the hustle and bustle so it's peaceful when you need it to be!;5;0;0;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Stacey1990wa;Best hotel experience i have ever had! 100% would recommend to everyone;absolutely amazing!! catered to everything that we needed! I asked the lady at reception to put us in a higher room and she put us on the top floor! the view was amazing. For the location it was perfect.. close to everything and without the noise and rush of the busy bali streets as it was tucked away and felt like you were secluded! the pool was absolutely amazing perfect temperature and always somewhere to relax Thankyou everyone at the Stones! I will be returning :D;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Diageo;Bali 1st timer;Stones hotel has a cool, modern vibe with very spacious and comfortable rooms. The location is excellent right across Kuta beach. It is walking distance to many of the popular attractions. I would love to go back and stay in this hotel more and enjoy the facilities.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Julia A;Vacation with a child to Kuta Bali;Absolutely great hotel in every little detail. Hotel is decorated with various stones, rooms have a terrace with a bath and a sofa, everything is very clean and well maintained, bed is a dream come true, excellent WiFi, service is very very good, choice of food in the restaurant is god and every dish is extremely good, breakfast - great selection of anything you could think of, kids club facilities really interesting and various activities offered to the children (kids club is free 3 hours a day), spa was very very enjoying. Hotel is located next to the famous Kuta beach. I advise, no doubt.;5;0;1;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Taz2607;The Stones - Love this hotel.;I love this hotel and will definitely be staying here again. Close to everything, but not the slightest bit noisy given the hotel is laid back from the road. Well appointed and clean rooms. Fantastic pool, spa and pool bar. I would highly recommend.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;chrisgeo123;Relaxing;We booked a weeks accommodation at the Stones and have had a wonderful stay. The room is clean and well maintained, the pool area as well is well kept. I'd find it very difficult to find a fault as everything from friendly staff to hotel cleanliness, promptness of service is five star. The breakfasts are also delicious. If you choose to have your holiday stay at the Stones you will not be disappointed just make sure you book a balcony pool facing room - definite must! Thank you to the wonderful hotel staff for making our holiday stay a memorable one.;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Philip T;Would stay again;Loved this hotel. Very modern and up to date. The hotel is very clean and the service is awesome. From the time you check in they offer you a wet cloth and ice cream. The breakfast buffet is delicious with everything you could ask for. Pool area was really nice and relaxing. About a 10-15 minute walk to Kuta beach and right across from Legian beach. If we go back to Kuta we will stay here again.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Adrian S;very relaxing stay;stayed for a total of 8 nights. found the hotel was very clean and nice. rooms were always cleaned to a high standard and always done before lunch time. a few amenities were missing but a quick phone call to reception and this was rectified in a quick manner. pool was very nice and clean. plenty of lounges around the pool to choose from and in the mornings a clean towel on the chair waiting for you, no need for a towel card or anything. location was good, a bit of a walk in the peak of the day and not too much shade along the road so was always nice to return to the hotel hot and bothered and go for a swim. pros- clean room, lovely balcony with bath over looking the pool and a lounge chair to relax on. pool was awesome. reception staff very helpful and friendly. gym was really;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ammar J;Super friendly staff and amazing location;Visited Bali for the first time and stayed at the stones Marriott for 3 nights. When checking in we were upgraded to the pool view room with balcony and tub. The welcome letter from the manager and chocolates in the room waiting for us in the room upon arrival were a great touch. The food we ordered from room service was also pretty good. The hotel is right across the road from kuta beach and we could walk there anytime. The location is great with beach walk at walking distance and discovery mall a short taxi ride away. There are numerous eateries and spas that you can easily walk to. If there's anything we can suggest for improvement it would be to renovate the hotel slightly so that it gives the look and feel of a new hotel.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;JimiFaizal;Excellent hotel near the beach;"Awesome hotel with exceptional service at The Stones.The room is superb and very suitable for honeymooners!great value for money.Location is excellent with many eateries nearby..The beach is just ""The Stones"" throw away!Recommended";5;1;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Omaya S;Amazing hotel - little haven of luxury right opposite Kuta beach !;Cannot say enough good things about this hotel. A few people warned us against staying right in Kuta as it can be noisy and some people say a little seedy. That was not our experience at all and I think our hotel had a lot to do with that. Set back a bit from the main road and right opposite the beach, it was so quiet, immaculately clean and a lovely haven from a busy day of sightseeing. The pool is absolutely lovely - and there are lots of restaurants in walking distance. Would definitely recommend.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;SLW16;Wonderful hotel!;We stayed for three nights back in November, 2015. The room was very nice! It was spacious, clean, modern and had a very good view of the pool. The balcony had a bathtub which my partner used once. We swam in the pool several times and it was very relaxing, comfortable environment. The breakfast buffet was also great! We called for room service several times and they were a bit slow at first but overall nothing to complain about! The hotel is only a short walk from the shopping mall (Beachwalk) and had good security. Highly recommended!;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;BinayakDasgupta;Heavenly, Classic, Cool and Great Location.;Stones Bali: It's a fantastic hotel located just at the beach. The entire hotel has rooms lined around the pool located in the middle. The pool is huge and extensive with children's pool and jacuzzi. Don't miss the jacuzzi at all. It's brilliant. The restaurant beside the pool is quite good. We had a small working lunch there and then hit the pool. Our tour was sponsored by Herbalife therefore we had almost the entire hotel to us. Food is good and was served at the outer ring of the hotel. Some of the rooms have a small pool within. Mostly the ground floor rooms. All the rooms have bath tub in the balcony overlooking the pool. Rooms are very neatly arranged with our room having the washroom upon entry to the left and then the bed etc.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Simon Meng;very nice Stay here;the hotel very near Legian Beach, not direct front, cause there is a long wall along the beach, you have to cross the street to the beach, it's not hotel private beach. the room is nice & clean, quite comfort. it's a romantic place for couples. the hotel pool is very nice, I can sit there relax.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;asmcneil;Nice rooms bad location;Let's start at the beginning...The room was nice but not impressive. The layout was a little strange. It was modern and clean but a bit tired. I agree with previous reviews where people have mentioned that the bathroom is a bit strange in its open position. It just seems awkward and doesn't fit together nicely with the room. However, the balcony was very impressive. It was quite spacious and we had a lot of privacy. Absolutely loved the bathtub in the balcony!! It was so relaxing and so big! I was so looking forward to the pool and loved it!! It is beautiful from the balcony and from the lower ground! And it's really big, so you don't feel like you;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Haaris195;Stayed here Feb 2016;No other word to describe this hotel other then amazing. Bali is full of insect, this place is squeaky clean, in a very good location, around 10 minutes walk from Kuta BeachWalk. We got the pool view room with bathtub on balcony - room was excellent size, balcony was very good. Breakfast was amazing, with a huge choice to select from. We arrived early - got our room early - was impressed facilities were good. I'd recommend if you're staying in Kuta Beach.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Shannon_Perth;Celestine Spa;We got a a free 60min traditional Balinese massages with our hotel package. The spa is very clean & luxury. We will pay for a massage next time as it's worth the money & great prices. The spa has packages for kids as well.;5;1;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;101Nothappy;Brilliant hotel;Wow, what a brilliant hotel. The view overlooking the pool was perfect. The morning breakfast is to die for as was the massages on premises. Absolutely loved it. On a side note it amazes me how the beauty and splendour of this magnificent hotel is literally meters away from dirty and grimy Kuta Beach streets. A pity the surroundings are not of the same high standards and cleanliness.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ginetta P;Amazing Hotel! Great Staff! Great location!;Have just returned from 6 days at this hotel and had a wonderful time. We had a deluxe room with a pool view which is a must as the deluxe rooms without a pool view have no balcony. Clean and Comfortable. There are no bath ROOMS as such just a shower that opens up into the foyer of your room which offers little privacy for two sharing with a friend. Shower was great though. No baths for twin share either as ALL rooms with baths are for couples only???? Strange. We missed having a bath on our holiday and envied all those bathing on their balconies 😢 The spa offers great treatments however is very expensive approx $80 for 60min massage. Massage was amazing though. The food is great but also a little pricey. Breakfast was amazing;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;russell86;Great little hotel;Fantastic little hotel, they take care of the little things most people miss but make a huge difference. Arrived at check in to ice lolly and cold face cloth, given the room very quickly. Lovely room and view, bath salts and bath bombs a great touch. Clean and tidy hotel, great breakfast, lovely dinner menu, great little spa and checkout was easy. We asked for late checkout and was given it immediately which helped as our flight wasn't until midnight. Great location would definitely go back.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Johnnylegroom;Unexpected Quality;I have stayed in this area of Bali several times. When I knew the location of this stay, I rolled my eyes in despair as this area can be cramped, crowded and with dubious accommodation quality. However when I arrived I had to unroll them pretty quickly. The Stones Hotel is of a much higher standard than expected, more like the upmarket properties at Jimbaran or Nusa Dua. An unusually vast area opens up into an expansive lobby leading to the protected pool, restaurants and bars. Stones has only been open a couple of years so everything is spanking new. The rooms are decorated to a high standard of comfort and amenities. My room had a discrete bath and a day bed on the outside balcony. Cool! A great place to relax with a G&T after a long day! A very good buffet breakfast sets;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Charlotte G;Perfect !;The location is perfect (2 minutes by walk from the beach). The room was very clean, so bright and the bed REALLY comfortable ! The swimming pool is huge and never crowded so you can fully enjoy it.;5;0;1;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;wetrainteachers2016;Best I've ever been treated!;I arrived here as part of Marriott's Platinum Premier Club which meant I was using points to stay here. I'd been at the JW Marriott Jakarta only nights before and was brushed off a bit because I was 'staying at no charge.' The response here was quite the opposite! They went out of their way to help me feel special and even escorted me to my room to point out the features. That has never happened in my life. You must stay here if you're in the area. Great location - across the street from beach - and feels like an oasis in Kuta/Legian!;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Sergi R;Top Hotel & Service;Rooms are new and clean, the swimming pool is amazing and well mantained. The restaurant serves great food . They pay attention to detail. The only problem I would say is location , Kuta beach is not clean but at the same time you are near the shopping mall and restaurants.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Amy L;Beautiful hotel made perfect stay;My friend and I stayed here for 4 nights in September when visiting Bali from the UK and I have to say I absolutely loved the hotel. The breakfast was incredible, there was everything you could ever imagine! Our room was perfect, really clean and tidy, aircon was fab and worked perfectly! The balcony with the bath overlooking the pool was luxury, we where on the side so our view was quite restricted by trees but to be honest we preferred this.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Yibbasmum;First class hotel;The Stones is such a beautiful hotel with an amazing pool area. The buffet breakfast was amazing with everything you can think ofincluding icecream for breakfast! Such a surprise to actually have great coffee in Bali too. Recommend a balcony room as they all over look the pool and have a bath on the balcony which was great. Good location across from the beach with a short walk to shops and restaurants. Recommend checking out the rooftop bar at the front of the hotel for sunsets which have individual pools to swim in while you watch the sun go down.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;buzzedlight;"Nice ""little"" luxury hotel in the heart of Kuta";This hotel offers convenient location with amazing luxury amenities. The (barely) bad part: - Checking-in process. We arrived at the hotel right around 3 pm, but our room wasn't ready and we were told it'd be ready in about 30-45 minutes. Unfortunately, we waited over an hour at the end. However, we were offered some sweets and fresh towel while waiting at the lobby, so this was a nice touch. The good part: - The room. We got the suite and the room was amazing (as you can see from the photos). The room was very spacious and the bathroom was incredibly nice with two rain showers. It also had a balcony with a tub as well as a chair for relaxing outside. - The breakfast. The breakfast buffet was one of the best we ever had at any hotel in Asia. Not as fabulous;4;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;kambing_meek;Amazing Hotel;Only spent two nights and i m amazingly amazed by the hotel's service in all aspect. Location is at Kuta, so traffic can be bad. But everything else is readily available within walking distance. Beach is just across the road, or you can choose the pool which is amazing. Room is so splendidly cleaned and maintained. Comfortable bed and pillows. Room view is awesome, i had mine facing the pool and it still quiet. Everything in the room is properly planned with coffee machine, alarm clock, ironing table.;5;0;1;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Minesh C;Amazing Hotel close to the Beach;Beautiful hotel close to Kuta beach Pleasant staff. Amazing pool view room. Great amenities. Big gym and clean pool. Enjoyed it. Not many vegetarian options at the The Stone Kitchen. But great spread at the Breakfast Buffet. Value for money. Tight security makes you feel safe and comfortable. Overall a great place to spend your time in Kuta. Highly recommended.;5;1;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;EmmaMelbourne22;A little luxury in Legian;What can I say. This hotel is luxurious! We had a pool view room with a bath on the balcony which was a novelty. This hotel doesn't have much personality, but what it does have is the feeling of luxury and experience of a hotel from a big name group. The location is great, just across the road from the beach and a 10minute walk to Kuta. Security is tight, you will need to walk through metal detectors when entering/leaving the hotel. We are never particularly worried about security when we're in Bali but for some people this might be welcome. The rooms are modern, clean and spacious. The service was good albeit a little impersonal. The day spa is fantastic albeit expensive. But sometimes you want a luxurious day spa experience, not just a cheap massage in a street parlour.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ming Chia Kao;Amazing experience;Hotel located right next to Kuta beach, which is a one-way road towards the north in between connects Beachwalk shopping mall and other hotels. In other words you will have to take a big circle to Beachwalk by taxi, which takes around 45 to 60 minutes depends on traffic. The security check at the gate was serious, they'll open the doors to check and note the name of driver. The hotel was quite new, everything was white marble including floor, reception desk and even ceiling at lobby. We arrived around 11 AM but the reception was so nice to let us check in at around 12 PM with a complimentary drink and snack. Really enjoyed the room which is spacious and clean, to take a bath at balcony was quite interesting. The pool was large and beautiful. Breakfast was served at the mixed;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Sean L;Best place to sit back and chill;I've been to Bali many times and this time the goal of my trip was to just relax. No nothing just relax at the hotel, eat out and get massages. The room is clean and just awesome (we stayed at the pool view room on 5th floor) Staff are nice and always helpful and the best thing about this hotel is the pool. I could just sit by the pool all day. If you want to sit back and relax, this is the right place.;5;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Fernando L;great hotel , nice pool, excellent location, great service;Had 4 nights stay in this hotel Nov.14-18,2015. The room is cozy, and the pool is big and nice, very good place for relaxing. They offer variety choice of breakfast, so you don't really get tired everyday. Do try the fresh fruit bar and got the fresh squeeze juice. 10 mins walking to the beach walk mall if you have to. Hotel room price is reasonable. Did have a great time in this hotel.;5;1;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;luvholidays210;Fantastic pool;Very modern hotel in a great location straight across from the beach, next to legian markets and restaurants. Lovely breakfast with everything you could imagine including freshly squeezed fruit juices and cappucino. This hotel has the best pool i have come across in bali so far with plenty of pool lounges in and out of the water. They have a policy of not being allowed to save pool lounges by leaving a towel on them and then not using it for hours so was never a problem getting a lounge. I would recommend the pool facing rooms with private pool on ground floor or bathtub on balcony from second floor up. This hotel maybe a little on the expensive side however it shows;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Kristi3333;Best Hotel with the best customer service!;I travel for work and stay in hotels across the US. I have never experienced such great customer service as I have at the Stones Legian Hotel. The hotel was clean, modern and the people that work there go out of their way to make sure each and every person's stay is the best that it can be. We plan to come back to the Stones Legian hotel every year. Wonderful!!!!;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;sailon888;Outstanding service and great location;We stayed here for 4 nights in Sept 2015. Service was absolutely outstanding from start to finish. Room was on the fourth floor and average size with a balcony overlooking the pool. Balcony had a nice soaking bathtub which my wife just loved. Top to bottom curtains on the balcony give privacy. First floor rooms facing the pool had a small pool with jets rather than a tub and also the curtain. Looked really nice, but did not offer much privacy. Higher rooms much better. Food at the hotel restaurants was consistently good.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;ShelleyPerth;I love this place!;Just got back from a weekend getaway in Bali.. And the Stones didn't disappoint. Have stayed here twice now and will certainly stay again! From the service in the pool (the blowup pool boat serving fruit and beers) to the to-die-for breakfast buffet... Stones is certainly worth the money. I even got my sunglasses cleaned daily by the bar staff while I was sun baking!;5;1;0;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;DinaHabib;Beautiful Hotel!;It was our first time in Bali- Kuta and Legian and I just can't describe how much the Marriott made our stay 100 times better than we expected. The location is amazing in the middle of the city center almost close to Seminyak where you want to be, incredible pool, great cuisine and breakfast, rooms and cleanliness perfect goes without saying. The whole experience exceeded our expectations, not to mention that Bali is RIDICULOUSLY BEAUTIFUL.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;rinny03;Nice hotel;Beautiful hotel and in a great location opposite the beach. The pool is great and the rooms are nice. The breakfast is amazing and has such a big variety. This hotel is very westernised though so if you want to experience the Bali culture this is more commercial.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Minister-of-Food;Clean Hotel, central location, value for money;This hotel is called The Stones although it also shows some affiliation to Marriott group though not clearly. It is centrally located in Kuta city. Clean hotel, and spacious room. The rooms overlook the pool and a music pavilion which can get pretty noisy at night. The check in and check out process is tedious but if you can get over the nitty gritty details its a good hotel and value for money. The morning buffet breakfast is limited but sufficient. There is no particularly wow factor about this hotel but it ticks all the boxes if you are on a business trip or if you are looking to get a quick city getaway in clean and 4star conditions.;4;1;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Tore T;Great Hotel;The Stones is a large hotel with many guest however their service is very good, room is clean even a Bose for playing your own music indicates what the hotel is all about. We like to exercise when traveling hence a good gym was most appreciated, together with a great dining on the hotel. Only suggest I could think of is to staff up the SPA so that it is possible to book on a drop in basis...;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;andrew t;ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!;My partner and I stayed at The Stones for 10 days and we loved it so much. When we arrived the reception area makes you feel like you're somewhere so luxurious. The buffet breakfast was exceptional. So many choices. Pastry heaven! The pool was so big, you could easily have your own little private area. The rooms were so clean & the beds WOW like a cloud! One of the bests! Definitely would stay again! Highly recommend to couples :);5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Cjsimon11;Great all rounder!;My wife and I stayed at the Stones for four nights. Couldn't fault it if I tried. Clean and tidy. Pool is clean and chilled for hot days. The gym is exceptional for a resort with a great range of equipment. The breakfast was also fantastic with an great array of food including Indonesian food which I enjoyed for breakfast (give the bali Benedict a go!). Would definitely come back if staying at Legian!;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;pipi1994;Amazing;This was amazing, everything about this hotel was simply perfect. We had the pool view room with a bath tub on the balcony. The grounds are fabulous, afternoon entertainment was Devine and the rooms were clean, neat and decent size. The breakfast was huge and good quality, and located right at the beach front it was perfect to go buy a coconut and talk to some locals.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;SSM;Good hotel;Nice location, great breakfast, great pool and superb pricing. It generally comes for about 150$ and I think thats great for a hotel of this quality. Nice amenities in the rooms and a nice gym too. Very conveniently located. Ofcourse after traveling to Bali, I'd rather get out of Kuta and go to the quieter locales, but hey its great to walk around to Legian street.;4;1;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;gami1986;Lovely hotel, friendly staff;Excellent hotel with a great location. We had booked regular rooms, but got upgraded to pool view rooms when we arrived. The room was well-appointed, and overlook the large pool. I loved the location of the hotel - the entrance is a little way off the very busy main road, and hence gives the feeling of privacy. However, all the happening areas of Kuta etc. are very close by (2-3 km walk), and hence the hotel is very good for people looking to catch the late-night-party action in the Kuta-Legian area. We in fact hired a 2-wheeler to get around, and that was extremely convenient.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Sébastien R;Great & Peacefull Holidays;Everything was perfect. Hotel is very modern, clean, perfectly located 10m by walk from the mall beachwalk (walking way available and safe even with kids). Hotel is located in front of the beach (just a road to cross) Swimming pool is very large and food are excellent but expensive as usual in this kind of hotel. I will come back again!;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;MumfordSons;Great hotel BUT noisy day and night!;We only had a couple of nights at The Stones Hotel and whilst we were very impressed with hotel cleanliness, we couldn't help but be irritated by just how noisy the hotel was. Perhaps we just had a noisy couple of days (we had a ground floor plunge pool room), but we had disrupted sleeps on both nights by people rolling in at 3am being very noisy and then families with kids screaming down corridors at 6am. Poolside during the day was also noisy. To be honest, the noise probably just sums Kuta up!;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Sean M;Wonderful Holiday;My partner and I had an absolutely amazing time staying at The Marriot Stones Hotel - Legian Bali, Autograph Collection. We stayed for 8 nights in one of the Deluxe Room, Pool View hotel rooms and it was fantastic. The room was immaculate, and modern with wonderful finishing's and beautiful decor. The buffet breakfast was incredible, with an amazing selection of food which caters to everyone's pallet. The pool was the best part of the hotel and as such, where we spent most of our time. The location could not have been any better as well, as the hotel is across the road from the beach and only a 2 minute walk to the Kuta Markets. Unfortunately I fell sick (stomach bug) for two days, but fortunately for us, the Stones provides;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Justina&Roger;Best Breakfast;Nice, big and modern hotel. The breakfast was magnificent, the best in whole Bali with different themes and ice-creams. Nice pool but be there in time to get a good spot in the sun. Nice and clean rooms.;4;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Brooklyn B;"Great Hotel; Good Location";First visit and first hotel we stayed in upon arriving in Bali. We booked here because of the Marriott connection, and because of the other great reviews here on TripAdvisor. The property did not disappoint. Had a good sized room on the 1st floor (garden view), nice & cool air conditioning, two double beds (very comfy), clean, etc. On a return visit with more time, I would love for either a pool view room on the 1st floor (all of those seemed to have their own private plunge pools), or a higher floor facing the pool (most seemed to have balconies with tubs on them). We were only here two nights and one full day and were out exploring or out at the pool most of the time anyway, so the garden view worked just fine for us. The included breakfast in the on-site restaurant;5;0;0;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;rwa95;Hidden Gem in a Busy Spot;Made a reservation here for a recent conference that I was attending, mostly because it was a Marriott property. They do not disappoint. One of the nicest amenities (only on 1st floor pool view rooms) is the small private pool attached to each room. It was so nice after a long day in the sun to be able to come back and relax in a private setting. The location is on the popular Kuta Beach and can get very busy but the way the hotel is situated, you'd never know. Given the opportunity, I would stay here again and again.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Lauren_lab90;Great stay, exceeded expectations!;Wow! This hotel is superb! Stayed in the stones hotel for 4 nights, in a great location as its only a 10 minute walk to Kuta and Seminyak isn't too far away either. The hotel is a bit back from the main road so you don't hear the traffic. rooms were clean & for the price it is definitely value for money. The buffet breakfast is definitely worth getting & the dinner menu is good too, service was always outstanding. We upgraded to a pool room, the only suggestion would be to have the pools as a spa too. The only disappointment about this hotel was upon check out we were continually charged per item (food & drinks) extra tax rather than just tax on the total amount.;4;1;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;rosegirl93;Just Amazing;We stayed at the Stones for a week. It was amazing. We are going to stay here on our next trip to Bali. We just really like the pool, the gym and hot spa. Everything about the Stone is just so professionalWe both really loved the breakfast buffet, now that was amazing we have never had such a breakfast choice before and we have been visiting Bali for 13 year and staying at different hotels each time. We go to Bali 2 and 3 times a year. Every things is so very clean. We could not say enough about this beautiful hotel and the staff. Highly recommend.;5;0;0;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Phoebelam17;Amazing hotel;This has to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The rooms were clean. Breakfast was amazing. The pool was very nice with hammocks and daybeds for you to sit alongside in. It was also walking distance to the beach as well as many other things on the tourist street.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Alaisha D;Beautiful hotel, impeccable service, perfect stay;The hotel is beautifully presented and the facilities available i.e. gym, accommodation, restaurants, pool, poolside facilities, spa, security, free wi-fi, concierge etc were top notch. The quality and range of food served in the various restaurants was excellent especially the breakfast buffet - having stayed for 12 nights we still didn't manage to try everything available! The location is superb, being just across the road from the public beach (less than a 2 minute walk) and a five minute walk from a hip and happening new shopping mall and a plethora of beachside restaurants and bars.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;rosarose19;Definitely will be back!!;I was at this hotel last Christmas with my family to attend a wedding. Had a nice room overlooking the pool. Separate bath and shower. I love the outdoor bath tub, so great!!! This is not only an amazing hotel, with a great location and a high quality of standard, but it also feels like home. Loved the evening entertainment by the pool and the cocktails! Thanks Dude and his amazing staffs to make our stay enjoyable! PS : coming back soon this year!!;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Davie13;A good hotel in a great location;We stayed two nights at the Stones as we wanted a good hotel in the Kuta area and this was recommended by our travel agent. This is a good hotel, it is very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable, probably the best beds I have slept in in Bali. The pool bar is really good and not badly priced, when we were there it was easy enough to get sun loungers so you could enjoy a nice lazy day by the pool. Breakfast is very impressive and there is something for everyone, except the bacon is beef bacon and not very nice and the sausages are chicken and are bland, but, that said, there are plenty of other things to choose from. The disappointment about this hotel comes from the absence of a comfortable lounge are to sit on an evening, there an are that sort of fits but, it is;4;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Rahul_Baba;You just dont want to get out of the pool;My wife gifted me the stay in the hotel for my Birthday and I simply loved it. The pool outside is quite big, clean and so relaxing that you want to be inside it all day in spite that the beach is just outside the hotel. Gym is nice and you can listen the Balinese music which is quite soothing to ear all the day. The only thing which we missed there was activities at night. It looks like abandoned place at night. The bars, coffee house are almost half a mile away from the hotel. The hotel has its own restaurant outside but its not worth a visit. Still an amazing place to stay.;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Mountain Outdoors;Great service;We had a wonderful stay at The Stones - clean pool, and very close to the beach. The rooms were clean. The only thing I didn't like was that the drain in the shower didn't drain properly, so when showering you ended up with a little pool at your feet.;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Wahyu Adi Sinty... D;Perfect time on the perfect place;We went to The Stones on last weekend and thats so perfect time for us. We wasting our time with laugh and awesome food. My favourite is wagyu beef, it's so perfect. Love the location, near with pantai Kuta and night life. Hopefully can back to this paradisee..;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;FloKorn;Nice Stay;We stayed here for 3 nights over Nyepi day. Check in was quick, front office staff was friendly and efficient. Very good breakfast selection, Big fish Restaurant and Long Rice Table, serve as well nicely presented and tasty food for lunch and dinner, service is well trained and attentive, thanks to Christian Acker, the F&B Manager. Rooms are well maintained and clean. Overall a pleasant stay with excellent value for money.;4;1;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;YZ8888;You are treated like a king here;Really nice hotel. Rooms are clean and tidy. Did our laundry in 4 hours without any extra charge as we are running short on our fresh tshirts. The wanyu beef burger is the bar is the best! Must try! There are a lot tourists in the hotel. So if you want some quiet, peaceful get away. Don't come here. Very convenient to go to places .;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Mediko A;Very nice hotel, good location @ Kuta;Stayed one night for business conference purpose and enjoyed the surroundings. Security is good when arriving. The room is spacious, awesome and everything is great. Have breakfast, break and lunch here and the food is nice. Cannot complain more. Kuta beach is just walking distance. Too bad, it's only one day. Will certainly return when in the neighbourhood.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Gemma E;Amazing;From the moment we arrived it was perfect! Rooms are very clean and have everything you need. Pool and pool area are very relaxing. The buffet is exceptional I have never had a better one. It has everything! Would highly recommend and will definitely be returning on our next trip. Wish we could of stayed longer.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Pri8181;Wonderful stay!;Loved my stay. The location is great. The room had everything that I needed, the bed was very comfortable and the pool view was beautiful.;5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Amanda H;Rooms were Loud;We stayed here for one night and then moved on to a different hotel. The rooms were nice but noisey at all hours of the night... no sound proofing from the hallways. Also, the bathroom didn't have a sealed door with fan so if you had to go to the washroom there wasn't really any privacy from whoever else was in the room. Pool was nice but busy. The food and drinks were also really good but we found it to be very expensive compared to other restaurants in the area. The location is prime.. it's just across the street from the beach and next door to a great surf school!;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Cjlego;Perfect;Location is just off an awesome beach, large pool, breakfast was sumptuous - juice bar was great, service was world class. Marriott, way to go. Town of Legian or Kuta is an easy walk away. Or if you prefer, a few USD cab ride away. We will definitely select again, if and when we are in Bali next. We were upgraded and the bathtub in the balcony was nice.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Tony C;Will be Back;From the collection at the airport to the escorting to the room. the rooms are great, large, clean and serviced every day. Restaurant was great, huge selection of meals at a very affordable price, we will not talk about the breakfasts, the size of my stomach says it all! Enjoyable days spent by the pool and on the odd days we went out it is only a short stroll to either Kuta or Legian. We will defintely be going back again.;5;1;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Aus_andy79;The Best in Bali;We have been to Bali five times and stayed in a variety of hotels and visited even more. I say without much hesitation that this is our favourite and certainly where we will stay next time. The location isn't quite in the middle of the action but close enough that its not an inconvenience to get to. more just the little things such as making sure the aircon was on before we arrived so the room was cool and giving us extra towels to lay upon as the sunbeds were warm, but it is the little things that make the difference and they ere too numerous to list. The pool is lovely and we always love a swim up bar (It was maybe a little too expensive compared to others that usually have a variety of specials to choose from ) My only complaint was that every taxi;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;JLL27;One of the nicest hotels in the area!;The hotel was very impressive, featuring a nice pool area, great breakfast buffet. It is located directly across the street from the beach. We found Kuta to be very hectic and more of a party area and preferred to spend our days more in the heart of the island. This required a good amount of time in the car, but transportation is very cheap and tours will pick up from this location. The hotel is a little loud, as noise from the pool area resonates throughout, but it was usually quiet by 9 pm, so there was no issue there.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Maan A;Amazing Amazing Amazing !!!;This is probably the best hotel we stayed in during our honeymoon. Hospitable, amazing and highly recommended. Rooms: we booked the pool view room deluxe room. but then we upgraded to the honeymoon suite. I loved the balcony, which had an amazing view and a tub. it was extremely chilling we sat there nearly everyday at the evening for hours and hours. Food: The breakfast was excellent, it had a lot of choices. we ordered something from the room service nearly everyday since the prices were very reasonable and the quality and taste of the food was great. Location: about 20 minutes away from the airport. This;5;1;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Lipstick007;A great experience!;This was my first trip to Bali. I had a wonderful stay at this property. It is very clean, terrific spa and fabulous breakfast. The location is within walking distance of a mall and many restaurants. I would definitely stay here again!;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;collo43;Amazing Service, Great Room;We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at The Stones. We were intending on booking a pool view room, but as we explored our booking options, we discovered that the Honeymoon Suite was only about $100 more per night, so opted for this instead.. For the extra cash we got a bigger room, but the absolute win was the private rooftop pool (which was bigger than we'd expected-in fact, it was as big as many small hotels' main pool - which was gigantic for just the two of us!). The view from the pool level was great also-across the rooftops to nearby Kuta Beach, as well as down to the main hotel pool area. The room was clean and tidy, the bed comfy, and the bathroom roomy (double shower) as well as having a bath on one of the two balconies.;5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Nick X;Really cool hotel, not even expensive;I used Marriott category 5 certs to stay here, and my platinum benefits were all recognized (upgrade, breakfast, welcome gift, 20% off food/drinks on resort), but I think you can book it for under $150USD which I think is a steal. It's a really pristine pool and we loved the balconies as well (which all have your own bathtub I believe). The location is good, close to Legian street, a shopping mall, Seminyak, etc. We didn't bother with the beach very much as it's pretty dirty, but we knew going in from doing basic research that the beaches are better around Nusa Dua as opposed to here. Sidenote: the design and feel of the hotel is very W-esque so if you like W's you'll feel right at home here;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Chris L;Worth the money;Booked in here for 2 nights on New Year's Eve after checking into a dump and checking out straight away. Although pricy was worth it as it was very luxury with nice rooms and clean. Gigantic pool for relaxing. Although set back from the beach still really close and to legian town centre. Amazing buffet breakfast 100% recconended .;5;1;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;jnck20;One of the BEST!;This is definitely one of the best hotels I have stayed at!! my boyfriend and I stayed here in October for a week, excellent location! it is across the road from the beach, and within walking distance to shops and bars. The food was fantastic! buffet breakfast is usually average at hotels, but this was enjoyable! fresh juices, pastries, egg station and even had a traditional Bali station. The hotel is overall superb, the pool and the rooms are extremely clean, the bed is comfy, and heaps of beach chairs around the pool to lounge, and a surprisingly quiet hotel! We would definitely recommend a pool view room though, much;5;0;1;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;ncis83;Outstanding Hotel in Bali;I stayed at the Stones Hotel last week for 5 nights with my husband - 2 nights at Deluxe Room (no balcony, only big glass of window that can't be opened, and no good view) and 3 nights at Deluxe Pool (with balcony, view to the pool). We are amazed with the room amenities, most complete breakfast buffet I ever experienced by far, clean and huge swimming pool, very comfort bed to sleep on. I guess this hotel has it all that I couldn't ask for more. This hotel has also good location - in the middle of Legian area and Kuta area, you can walk 10-15 mins to reach nice restaurants and you can walk across the street to see the beach even it's a public beach that's very crowded, if you don't like crowd just choose to go there in the morning when there's;5;0;1;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Michellehammo;Amazing!;This place is incredible. We had two rooms between our family- one stayed in one of the ground floor rooms with the personal plunge pool, and another with the pool view rooms with the bathtub on the balcony. The rooms are very clean, modern, comfortable beds, good hot water system, great lighting (though a little confusing with so many switches). Uniquely decorated. Great location- walking distance to many shops, the beach, nice restaurants, etc. Drinks and food are good quality and tasty. Though don't order an iced coffee- they're awful haha. In room complimentary;5;0;1;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;none70;Excellent;A very relaxing 5 day trip was perfect and the hotel just made it even more fantastic! Clean, modern and very friendly staff. The breakfast was amazing and catered for every nationality. The only addition I would suggest is to add American bacon to the menu. The rooms were spacious, clean and modern. The service around the pool area was a little slow and they could benefit from a buzzer system to attract attention. Overall a wonderful hotel and would definitely stay there again.;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Nushan Z;Great Service;Had a wonderful stay with my mother. loved the fresh juices and breakfast buffet everyday, pool area is amazing and well thought out, hotel room very clean and comfy and location couldn't be better.;5;0;0;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;bella072;Beautiful Hotel;Beautiful , relaxing pool area , perfect little paradise from the very busy Kuta. Rooms are very well equipped,spacious and clean. Fantastic breakfast . Great location if you want to be close to Kuta and close to the new shopping/restsurant complex The Beachwalk which has some great food outlets and roof top bars. If you can book a room facing the pool , well worth it! Will stay here again if returning to Bali;5;1;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;goody55;Fantastic Hotel at a Great Pricetag;"The Stones Hotel was fantastic, we would absolutely recommend to anyone. While the pricetag might seem a bit pricey for the Bali norm, it is worth it. The rooms were spacious and modern with all the facilities you would expect; free wifi, minibar, ipod speaker, etc. The rooms aren't the main attraction, however, which would be the large pool area in the middle of the resort. We spent the majority of many days simply relaxing on the sun chairs by the pool, or at the swim up bar, being waited on by the staff. The area is complete with personal cabanas (which need a minimum spend of 250,000 baht on food and drinks while in it), a kids indoor area and shaded hammock area.";5;1;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Cynthia B;Very nice!;Hotel rooms were very clean. Restaurant food very good and fairly priced. Provided quality ground transportation to explore other areas on the island. Walking distance to the beach and shopping. I highly recommend.;5;1;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Martine S;Truly Wonderful!;My husband and I have just returned from a truly relaxing 7 night stay at The Stones. This is the first time ever that we both agreed that a week was not long enough. I think I messaged our two teenage kids everyday, saying I cant wait to bring them back here. The staff are so polite and professional, with front desk staff remembering your name each day as you pass. The rooms are very clean and a good size. The bath on the balcony overlooking the pool, is a lovely touch. The pool is so wonderful, as is the pool bar, that we didn't even leave the hotel grounds for the first 2 days. We unfortunately missed a couple of themed dinners that we would have liked to try, so will definitely do them next time. My husband used the gym each day, and found enough weights equipment to satisfy;5;0;0;1;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;kageytraveller;Missing those extra little things to complete our stay for a special occasion!;We recently stayed at this hotel with three other couples for mu husbands 50 th birthday. It is a beautiful hotel in a great location. We loved the pool area ! It was never too busy and we could always get loungers although we were there in low season and it was not school holidays. We had a pool view room with a balcony which was very nice and I would recommend this room type. Breakfast selection was extensive and plenty of variety but it was probably average for taste. We had a few issues in our room ,the door fell off the fridge and the hair dryer was smashed on the inside but when I rang they were fixed immediately. The fridge for storing drinks was not cold at all The beds were great and nice toiletries were provided. What we were disappointed with was the fact that we had;4;0;0;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Tegan M;Perfect bit of everything;The stones hotel in Legian was great, when we got there we were overwhelmed with the lobby it was big, welcoming and impeccable. The security was high as our car was checked each time and we also had to walk through a scanner each time. We stayed on the second floor with a bath balcony overlooking the pool. The room was amazing and very nice. We had room service there the first night and then dinner at the restaurant the second night, we also ate and drank by the pool most days we were there. The food was tasty, well priced and no bali belly in sight! The location was also amazing being right across the road from the beach and a short walk away from kuta/main streets for shopping etc. I liked it because it was close but not too close.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;pearlypearl;Comfortable bed;"Stayed at this hotel for 2nights during my company's teambuilding session. Hotel location is within walking distance (about 10mins) to Beachwalk Shopping and Hard Rock. The bed was really comfortable, but there was a stain on a pillow; on a hand towel too. The coffee machine in the room was faulty but it was replaced very soon by the hotel staff. Like the idea of having an alarm clock by the bedside! There is no toothbrush provided, you will need to ask for it.";4;0;1;0;0;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;TrueReview8641;Girls trip to Bali;Girls trip to Bali. My 2nd time in Bali, their 1st. Really liked the Stones, food was great, rooms were very clean, quite, and beds were VERY comfortable (something that is a must for me). We were too busy to use the pool, but it looked beautiful and clean. - The cost of food at the hotel, is inexpensive and delicious. (I live in Singapore where everything is 3x the amount) So that was a nice treat. We used the Stones private car service for pick up and drop off at the Airport. So worth the little extra cost to ensure you are taken in a clean dependable car, and don't have any unexpected surprises along the way. Be advised, in this area of the island, security checks are at the;5;1;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Frances D;in the Heart of Town;We spent a delightful week at The Stones Hotel, Legion. Really enjoyable!

I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to be in a good location near everything.;5;0;1;0;0;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;JQ568;Exceeded our expectations;We chose this hotel for the price and for being close to the airport before embarking on our 12 day adventure throughout Bali. room was clean, breakfast was awesome with all of the options, the swim up bar and pool were also great. Beach just across the street with lots of surf schools if that's your thing. It's worth spending a few extra dollars for an upgrade to have a balcony or private small pool. Great value.;4;1;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;MizieD;Would love to stay longer!;We only stayed here for 4 nights, the hotel had security scan and check every car at a gantry and people entering the hotel have to walk through a metal detector as well - these security measures are much appreciated as after all the hotel right across Legian beach and anyone could walk in. Location - just off kuta going towards seminyak, it offers a little bit more serenity as kuta is bustling. to the left of the hotel is a brand new mall called beachwalk ( about 10 mins) which is in the direction approaching kuta, we also could walk to hardrock cafe/ kuta square in about 20-25 mins approx. Breakfast - I love the breakfast buffet here - the selection is great, asian/western food.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;FranklinRalte;Experience at The Stones;Stayed here during a conference in July'14 with my wife. Great location just next to Kuta beach! The check in was smooth and I love the open reception area which is connected to the massive pool area- gets you into that holiday mood immediately. The rooms are great.Choose rooms towards the poolside they have great views and a bathtub in the balcony, just perfect for a lazy afternoon soak! The food is good and reasonable, though you may find better options outside as Kuta beach is just a stones throw away with lots of other dining options. The only complaint I have is that the water in the shower sometimes smell a little earthy.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Hutama;Great location hotel;Beach is just front of the hotel, we took a great picture at sunset in Kuta beach.

They have small pool for jacuzzi which makes it eve better. Room was okay, modern design, comfy bed but not for their pillows ( should consider some upgrade ), separated shower chambers and toilets but they do not provide buth tub unless for swim pool view rooms ( consider to choose this room, bath tub is on balcony an dits only $500 price difference ). Locations bit at the end of Kuta beach so its bit far to access Hard Rock or Beachwalk.;4;0;1;0;1;0;1

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Wayne A;Great break;I stayed at the Stones with 3 friends in late June and we had a fantastic time. The rooms are in top condition, spacious and always clean. Food at the hotel is delicious and the drinks are cold and refreshing. Enjoyed a few Bintangs from the pool bar on more than one occasion. The hotel provided a very relaxing atmosphere during our stay. The corridors at night time can become a little noisy however the comfortable beds ensured that most nights a pleasant sleep was had. I will definitely stay at this hotel again.;5;0;0;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;travelnusa;Modernity in classic style;The Stones represents classic style to suit its name but has modernity inside. The pool is excellent and equipped with Jacuzzi. Breakfast tastes so great combined with Balinese traditionality and the staff gives out samples of Javanese herbal drinks to try out. The hotel is very clean, well organized. I like the way they decorate the bathroom, it looks simple and romantic as well (this is one of regular bedroom on 5th floor). The location is conveniently around end of Kuta beach road, nearby mall and shops with the beach locates just across the street.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Kho Sulung;Exceed expectation;It is a new hotel built less than 12 months ago. The hotel room is spacious, the king size mattress has brought me a very good quality sleeping time. The only thing that I am complaining is on the flooring, it will be great if the whole hotel room flooring is come with carpet. It is kinda awkward when your foot felt the cool tiles at the middle of the night. The location is not so near to the hard rock area or Kuta area but it is closer to the main street with spa and restaurants. The breakfast is amazing, this is the best hotel breakfast I ever had in bali. They got lots of varieties and good food. It is really worth your money;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;RogerWieser;Two thumbs up!!;We experienced a great weekend in this hotel with modern and clean rooms. An efficient check in with a welcome drink.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;chefgaet .;Great first stay will come back !;I usually do not make any review but i think it will be fair to do so for this hotel and the team thats work there. Overal great stay great value ,great location but the best part is the staff from the time i arrived , Cynthia from front desk ( sorry maybe wrong spelling) really answer all question and even anticipate some of my though and every day when see me greet me by my name and always looking to help. Annisa waitress at the restaurant was also very helpful and great quality service oriented with a small incident she made a great experience . and the last one i want to recognized is Suriya Bartender at the pool bar , she was just outstanding delivering very high quality of service and also as it was my first time in Bali she introduce me to local coffee thats was great and;5;;;;;;

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Matt C;Beautiful, great location and new construction hotel;We decided to stay at the Stones for 12 nights during our honeymoon. First trip to Bali. The hotel is tucked just behind the hustle and noise of the Kuta beach side street. No beach views, but that is really okay. I liked being in our own little bubble, then just taking a 3 minute walk to the beach. If you stay here, you MUST get a pool view room. Any other option and I wouldn't stay here. The pool is big beautiful. Palm trees, modern look, pool bar, night time entertainment and the evening lighting make this a perfect place to hang out at or just look at from the view from your balcony. The rooms are modern and have a nice bathroom w/ amenities. We stayed in both a balcony room w/ tub and private dip pool during our stay. I'd say I actually got more use out of the balcony.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Asd A;Love this hotel;I love this hotel, this has been my 4 visit to 'The stones' I love that it's nice an new and clean. I have stayed here twice with my family including 2 kids age 5 and 3. Everyone goes out of their way to make the kids welcome. I think that the kids clubs is one of the best in Bali both my girls loved it. One of the reasons I love this hotel is that it's not over run with kids. Older kids maybe bored, I think that there are better kids resorts for older kids. The rooms are light and airy, which I love, maybe on the small side. We had to get a suite for the 4 of us. I love the breakfast, so much to choose from, you can have waffles and pancakes. Location is good just a quick walk to the beach walk shopping centre, which has great western shops like topstop and Zara.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Breeza87;Outstanding;Stayed here for a week in May this yr and also for a week last year in November. Both times were absolutely incredible, hence why we returned for the second visit! The highlights as everyone mentions is the beautiful pool, the buffet breakfast and the cleanliness of the rooms. Only little thing this time was the nightly turndown service didnt seem to exist but while we were staying there it didnt fuss us enough to enquire about it as I'm sure it would have been rectified if we did.;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Rebecca T;Gorgeous hotel, would stay again!;Upon arriving we knew we were in for a treat! The staff were very accommodating and directed us straight to our premium pool room. DIVINE! The room was very clean and well set out. The bathroom full of modern fixtures. The breakfast buffet is amazingly huge and has everything you could think of. My only criticism is it takes too long to get your coffee after ordering. Not a deal breaker for me. We also ate a few times in the restaurant for lunch and dinner with great food. Although on the expensive side, we received great food! The location of the hotel is great. Close to walk into kuta and easy to access markets in and around legian/kuta area. We would be back for sure if returning to Bali!;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Sasha J;Fantastic service, consistent quality, great location;If it were possible, I'd offer Peter Brampton a sixth star in his 5 star crown at the The Stones Hotel, Bali. From the moment of our first arrival, the driver was waiting for us at the airport in a very comfortable hotel vehicle, transferred us to the checkin which was a breeze and our luggage magically appeared in our room before we arrived. We had two rooms for four people over one week, and both were impeccable, very modern, comfortable with want for nothing. The bath tub on the balcony was a dream, sitting in the tropical heat, overlooking the lagoon pool and hanging gardens. The daily breakfast service was truly diverse, Nils and his team quickly remember guest names, coffee preferences etc.;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Darwinaust;Amazing hotel, friendly helpful staff - Will be coming back for sure!;I am so glad I chose The Stones. On arrival we were upgraded to a beautiful pool room. Rooms are very clean, beds are comfy and rooms are a good size. Breakfast every morning was amazing, the spread of food was endless. We ate at the hotel restaurants almost every night. The wagu steak was delicious! Pool is amazing! My partner and I spent most of our holiday at the hotel. If you like the Kuta/ Legian area but want a 5 star hotel this is it. Very impressed and have already recommended to many friends back home :);5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Yee S;Wonderful experience at The Stones;If you're looking for a new hotel in Bali which offers outstanding rooms and service, look no further than The Stones. efficient room service, warm welcome, big rooms with modern design, a big chill out pool and big gym facility. Not to forget the variety of breakfast offered. Simply awesome. Oh, don't forget to request for a free room upgrade! You might get a pleasant surprise. :) As for location, i went in February which was kind of a lull season for Bali, although the Kuta beach was just right in front of us, there were not many activities available and the beach wasnt the cleanest or most beautiful. Nonetheless, taxi in bali is very affordable and there wont be any problem cabbing to;5;1;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Deepti K;Excellent service;This hotel certainly met our expectations. Food is good. Everything in this hotel is very artistic. This hotel is right in the front of Kuta-Legian beach which is not very clean. We stayed in this hotel for 2 days. Though the location is not the best, we loved staying here for 2 days. Hotel room is like a paradise. Bathtub in the balcony is the best part. Legian has a lot of good restaurants and good massage places. Thanks for making our stay memorable.;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Derek S;Great pool and breakfast;-Rooms are very modern and chic. Rooms don't have much of a view, its either of the parking lot or the pool(lacks a little privacy) -Pool is great(too warm for my taste). -Great location a little far away from the night life and the main shopping areas(if your walking) -Breakfast was amazing, the breads are fresh and moist, (bread pudding is exceptional). A great selection of fresh squeezed juices also.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;the_ange23;Great, Central Hotel;I stayed at The Stones for a work conference with a large group of people. The Hotel was ideal as it also has conference/function rooms within the property which meant we didn't need to waste time travelling to and from another location. The room was well appointed, spacious and very comfortable. The one negative is that upon entering into the room, you enter into the bathroom before continuing through to the bedroom. This can be quite an interesting scenario when sharing with a colleague or a friend. The resort as a whole is great - modern, great layout, amazing pool, fabulous breakfast and set up. As you can see from the pictures, the pool is the hotel's stand out feature and it's great that there are so many different sitting spots around the pool, including hammocks,;5;0;0;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;vantw;nice and new hotel;we were staying here for 3 days for my cousin's wedding. breakfast was great with many different selections. Room was clean. Very nice size ~ The hotel is newer so it's a bit far from the market but with walking distance to the beach. It rains a lot while our staying so you might want to prepare rain coat or something that could keep you from wet.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;amazinggirls;excellent as marriot member;this hotel location was great but you need walking to beachwalk or hard rock cafe from this hotel. this hotel breakfast was excellent with ice cream and variation of food. the security and staff was good. hotel room too but remember if you wanna check out make sure on time or they lock the door even your luggage still inside and the process to unlock the key little bit longer that marriot on other countries. so i suggest they can be like other marriot member on other countries. overall great. bathroom was good with separate between shower and toilet room. to reach the room we need walking the pool. the receptionist also can give you two keys room.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Aaron G;Great place to Relax and love life;This hotel was fantastic. If you are searching hotels in Bali where you dont want to have to worry about anything at all please book this place. From the second you walk in you are greeted with ice pops and refreshing towels. The pool is AMAZING, drinks are priced well and the breakfast option is phenomenal. If I ever go back to Bali I will definitely stay there again. Great location so you can walk accross the street to the beach or 4 blocks to the mall/plaza area A Marriott gem!;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Hayze01;Good but....;We stayed here for 5 nights over Christmas & booked 2 pool view interconnecting rooms as we travelled with our 2 boys (7&4). The rooms were clean & well appointed with the king room having a bath on the balcony. I would recommend pool view over ground floor pool access rooms as these rooms have no balcony or privacy. The pool area is gorgeous with plenty of chairs & great swim up bar & cabanas. Breakfast was great with a fantastic choice & my sons particularly loved the ice cream option for breakfast!!! Location was a bit out of the way for us & we will probably stay closer to Seminyak next time but overall a great option for Kuta area.;4;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;LZ_Cheong;Great holiday;We stayed here for 3 nites with our 3 yr old daughter. The hotel is very new, clean. Pool is fantastic although it was quite packed on our last day. Breakfast was good. Spread is wonderful. Location not so great, u have to walk a bit to get to kuta. But taxi is cheap. Security is tight. Legian beach is much nicer than kuta. Highly recommend.;4;1;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Chademan;Amazing hotel;Breakfast is amazing here with plenty of range The pool is beautiful but is hard to get a chair in the sun. Would recommend getting down there early or putting towels on chairs before breakfast like most people do Rooms are big and modern with a nice bed. The rooms which have the pool/spa outside are way too cold to swim in and never get sun. Location is near Kuta beach. It doesn't have a view of the beach but you can easily walk up and down the beach to Kuta central and Legian We will be back!;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;TammyPeacock;Pure relaxation!;Wow, I can't say enough nice things about this hotel. We stayed in a pool view room and I think this is perfect, it's located on the upper levels so you have a view and an outside tub on your balcony. Great location too. Right opposite the beach and a short walk to the beachwalk shopping centre. I had read in previous reviews that the bathroom is only seperated by a curtain, rest assured that the toilet and the shower (which has enough room for you to dry off) have their own doors! I have travelled most of asia and rate this as the best all-round hotel I've had the pleasure to stay in.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Arwin C;Exceptional!;Definitely opt for a pool view room. Great location, it is right across the street from the beach and is central to many activities in Bali. The service was exceptional and we loved the surprisingly delicious free breakfast.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Donnamay5;Amazing;I have been to Bali several times and have stayed at all types of accomodation, from villas to hotels ranging in price from $80-$800 per night this is by far the best place I have ever stayed. The rooms are modern and absolutely beautiful. The cleanest I've ever stayed in. When we first walked in to our room the smell was so fresh and clean. (Very important). We had a pool view room with a bath on the balcony. I would definately recommend upgrading to these rooms. Breakfasts were absolutely amazing. Australian chef does a brilliant job! A great gym on site for those whole feel the need. I will never stay anywhere else!;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;KtrenSouthAustralia;Great;We had a girls 5 day weekend at the Stones and it was great. The rooms are clean, pool is kept very clean & breakfast delicious. we ate in the restaurant and really enjoyed our meals. It's also across the road from the beach, close to a mini market, ATM & market shopping 5 minutes away. Possibly not a family resort but for older girls wanting a break it was sensational. Also a lot of young couples around.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Marleen;Great Hotel and Service;Stayed here for six nights and had very good service! The hotel was well kept with staff always ensuring guests are looked after. My room was very clean and serviced every day. The pool was excellent also.;4;0;0;1;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;ejb99tn;Nice oasis in Kuta, more of a couples hotel...;"I would have rated this hotel as ""average"" when comparing it to some of the more extravagant resorts in Bali, but the newness, and Kuta location pushed it to ""very good."" Likes: large pool, breakfast, walking distance to many restaurants and shopping, close to airport Dislikes: Needed 2 rooms for me/wife and 2 daughters (no rooms for more than 2 adults and single small child), a few hunded meters to the beach (beach had a lot of trash on it), pool was not child friendly (too open, too easy to disturb everyone). Overall, I believe the hotel is setup as a classy couples retreat. They should push this strength and advertise this... don't try to be everything to everyone.";4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;cleaner53;comfortable and convienient;Had a short but busy 3 days in bali and glad we chose the stones hotel as it offered facilities bar none-we used everything and found it first class and the staff welcoming and the food tasty and appetising-we will definately return as the location made it easy to get around bali and attend to our commitments(given the short time frame).;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Jade85;Wonderful new hotel;We had a short stay here for a conference and I found it fantastic. Great location in Legian right across from the beach. The rooms are very spacious and the amenities with in them are great. Check in was very smooth although check out took a bit longer as we were quite a large group. Breakfast was fantastic and my room mate was super impressed with the availability of gluten free options. I would come back and stay here for my own holiday too.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;LauraMayBee;Absolutely Perfect;We stayed here for 6 nights a d loved every minute of it! Rooms were beautiful and were cleaned every day, they even knocked a couple of times to make sure that everything was ok and to check if we wanted more water etc etc. Obviously the pool is a massive highlight, we didn't struggle to get sun beds, and the food from the bar/room service is very reasonably priced. Also the location was perfect, 5 minute walk to the left and you're at the legian markets, 5 minutes to the right and you're at poppies lane, and 5 steps across the road and you're right at the beach, but when you walk into the hotel it's like you're miles away instead of in the centre of it all. Oh and happy hour at the pool bar (2 for 1;5;0;1;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;iantdit;THIS IS A FIRST CLASS HOTEL;"I judge a hotel on the cleanliness of the room and the rest of the hotel, quality of the bed and quality of the shower. All of these points have been addressed but the staff stands out. If you wish to be in Kuta this is the place just a few steps from the beach for those wishing the surf. Kuta is the happening area. Sanur's Tamu Kami Hotel is where we stayed on our last trip to Bali several years ago. It is very nice if you are looking for the older very small hotel that is very peaceful. The Stones is a modern very well run Marriot that has everything any modern hotel should. We got the ""upgrade"" room that overlooks the pool area. We are on the forth floor which is nice as the pool/bar";5;0;1;0;1;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Chan78;Stones hotel legian;Definitely a great hotel to stay at the pool is amazing the service s really good.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Shitij S;Great service and good location;Location: The hotel has a good location on the Legian kuta beach (a surfers paradise). It is close to some of the high end and fancy night spots and restaurants facing the beach, ideal for family crowds. The hotel though is about 50 meters inside the road adjoining the beach so the rooms do not have a ocean view. The main Legian street which has all the night hotspots including pubs, bars, spa and restaurants is about 15 mins by cab.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;ngfrey;Gorgeous hotel but is in Kuta;The pool is gorgeous... mine was a pool facing Great place for quality relaxation. .. Great for family ! Worth the price... but location is in busy kuta area... if you like kuta then this is the best place to stay... better than boring looking Pullman ... no regrets for choosing this over pullman !

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Natalee G;AMAZING!!;"The Stones is an amazing hotel.We stayed for 10 nights. Great location on Kuta/Legian Beach. The rooms are huge, bed is comfortable, the aircon is great and the rooms don't smell damp like most places in Bali. Breakfast is amazing just as good as the Padma if not better (ice-cream, waffles, bacon, eggs, asian dishes, fresh juice etc.) The prices for lunch or dinner was quiet steep; however if you walk to the very front of the hotel there is the pool attached to the little bar which is good & reasonably priced. The main pool is huge and the same depth the whole way around. Find the Jacuzzi's up the very top of the hotel which overlook the beach WOW spectacular.!!! Will defiantly stay here again.";5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;DaveC;Superb Value;Loved it from the clean fresh rooms to the amazing breakfast - a real bargain in town oh and a great pool as well! Everyone seems to book a pool view room, I didn't see the point but hey that's me! ...............;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Aussiechix;Very happy with The Stones;We have just spent five days at The Stones in a pool view room, enjoying the bath on the balcony. Room, breakfast and service was excellent. In fact breakfast was probably the best we have had in many trips to Bali. The only downside is the location. At the Kuta end of Legian can be tricky. when coming from Seminyak, we asked taxis to drop us in Melasti Street (near the Megani Hotel) we then simply walked the 100m around the corner to the Stones. Otherwise it can add 30min to the journey negotiating through Kuta and then back along the beach.;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;lannycal;Amazing new hotel but lacks the bali touch!;Amazing! clean and new and incredibly stylish! Found out about Stones after reading about it in the Sunday paper and approached hotel directly for rate. Feel the other reviews on TripAdvisor are generally accurate. It is new (maybe 6 months has been open). We made the mistake of booking a Garden view (which meant a view of a dirty block next door and back of another building!) and would have loved a balcony and pool view but hotel was fully booked. Room design is a little odd - walking into the bathroom but didnt affect our stay. Pain is that having no outside area/balcony meant no where to dry wet swimwear/clothing and no fresh air. Air conditioning very good. Bed and linen were super clean and amazingly comfortable :-) What makes this hotel is by far its frienldy;4;0;0;0;1;1;1

It is a paradise with amazing pool, great rooms, relaxing ambience and accessible location. Prior to my arrival, i asked if I could possibly ask for assistance in making a surprise for my friend's birthday. And wow! They made everything for me without any hesitations and have even gone far beyond my expectations. My friend was very happy and it was something that she will never forget.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Mosmo;A quiet oasis;My partner and I recently enjoyed our stay at the Stones Hotel. This hotel is a lovely oasis away from the hustle and bustle (and hawkers!!!) of Kuta. It was peaceful and quiet, since it is set in from the street. We had a pool view room with a bathtub on the balcony. The location is great (right across from the beach!), and walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants. The hotel grounds are meticulously maintained. Our room was spotless. The pool area is large, with lots of lounge chairs and hammocks to hang out. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

Food and drinks are low priced for such a quality hotel, which makes it easy to relax. Location probably is ideal and let's you beat the traffic jams as you can walk to all locations in Kuta and Legian and only 10 minutes to Seminyak. Looking forward to returning.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Situated directly across Kuta Beach and Legian street, The Stones Hotel provides one stop access to beautiful sceneries, water activities, shopping sprees and food indulgence. Its 5 star rating speaks volume. Every commuter is required to pass through rigorous but not cumbersome security checks before entering the hotel.

The hotel was beautiful but it took us over 2 hours of car ride to get to from the airport!! There was a very grand shopping mall conveniently located within 10 minutes walk along with many bars and restaurants on the way. You will just need to endure breathing in all the exhaust from the cars and motorcycles sitting in the traffic while walking!

You need to take a taxi or walk about half an hour to the beach walk or kuta plaza! You know, under the big sun is good to surf in wave but not walk in a crowd street with peoples, cars, and motor! Beach is just opposite to the hotel! If you like to surf or swim! Frankly speak, it's a perfect hotel for you! Otherwise, you need to take taxi and bargain with those boring guy each time when you want to back to hotel! He charge me for 40000 rupiahs! I just can say it's really xxxx! So take your choice!;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Laurel W;Hotel with class;We stayed at this hotel for 5 days and loved every minute of it. We stayed in a pool view room and the room was so well thought out with the diffuser in the bathroom, the changing scented soap and the bath on the balcony with bath salts and a bath bomb. The breakfast spread is the best I have ever experienced, there was so much variety, even had Yakult. The pool was slightly warm but we were always able to get straight in without having to worry about if it was too cold. Poolside service was really good and the staff always wanted to have a chat. Location was quite good, we were able to walk to the centre of Kuta in 10 minutes and there were lots of places to eat within walking distance as well as the shopping centre with lots of brand names. I visited the spa twice and;5;0;1;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;crystal a;We will be back!!;Our room was so well kept, was super clean, fresh towels and water are provided and bath bombs and salts by the beautiful deep balcony bath tub were a lovely treat! The food and cocktails were amazing and the nightly entertainment was varied. We particularly loved the saxophone player of an evening on happy hour and were sad we missed the fire twirlers. There is a day spa in the complex but expect Western prices. -We opted to go to Murano Day Spa in Seminyak. They have a driver pick us up (20 min drive) and then we just taxi'd home ($5) Murano Day Spa were beautiful and had great prices yet in a beautiful spa;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Tersia A;Love It;We just finished a 2 night stay at the Stones. What a wonderful hotel. We were upgraded to a pool view room. I wished we had stayed longer. The staff were great and provided exceptional service. The location was great and close enough to the shops. Once you were in the hotel it was hard to imagine that busy Kuta was just down the road. The extra security was great and I would definitely stay again. I would recommend this hotel to all my family, friends and colleagues.;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;UmairR;Service, facilities and location excellence - its all about the experience!;My wife and I booked this place for our first anniversary - just through online research. These guys get it! Its not just about attending the desk, serving the food or facilitating the transaction for your room. With this luxury resort you buy in to the experience, and your needs are catered to from the first moment you approach the stone lobby desk to the moment you depart. Food excellence - top chefs prepare and present food from 3 different menus / restaurants sort of amalgamated. Room decor / comforts / extras are paush (illy coffee, organic vibrant signature soaps). Room extras are unique and exciting (the balcony soak tub is a must, but an investment in the private pool not necessary).

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Lori R;Great location, good (not great) service, strange room layout;"We stayed 5 nights at The Stones Hotel in May, 2013. It's a nice, new hotel with lots to offer. It is well located in Kuta - close to lots of shopping, the beach (across the road - no direct beach access) and restaurants. They also have very good security; they check entering cars very carefully for bombs and make you go thru metal detectors, something unfortunately made necessary after the bombings some time ago in Bali. Not all of our hotels did this. The hotel has a beautiful pool, which is tiled several shades of blue and green. They have a lot of cabanas, which are comfortable and FREE to use. The included buffet breakfast was one of the best we've experienced in a long time. Great baked goods, and lots of both Western and Asian options. However, it's hard to get a";4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;690JustinNZ;Beautiful Hotel!!;We booked 3 nights here and thoroughly recommended it! Absolutely gorgeous well-appointed sparkling clean room! Love the toiletries!! Bed is so comfortable. The hotel location is a little set back from the street, which makes it nice and quiet. It's a relaxing 10-15 minutes walk to the brand new BeachWalk Shopping Mall. The traffic around Kuta Beach is very congested, especially between 5 to 7 in the evening and during the 3 nights we stayed there, the traffic was almost stationery at those times so we had to get out of the taxi and walk, which was fine for us, it's quicker. Breakfast was set in a lovely and spacious;5;0;1;0;0;1;1

It is set back from the road away from the traffic noise. we had a room overlooking the pool. The hotel had excellent facilities and the location excellent. The hotel also provided an excellent breakfast with a huge selection on offer. We had spent several days in Seminyak a year earlier at a hotel which was slightly cheaper. There was no comparison between the two, with Stones being far superior in every way. We would definitely stay at Stones again without any hesitation.;5;1;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;happytraveller079;Lovely Hotel;Just returned from a 10 day holiday where my husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Stones Hotel in Bali. Great location, close to everything including restaurants and convenience stores. Also short walk to Kuta. The breakfast spread is fantastic and there are plenty of options for vegetarians as well. We had dinner there a couple of times and although a little bit pricey compared to restaurants near by, the food was really good. The staff are friendly and the rooms where cleaned really well. Only one day we arrived back to our room to find that it hadn't been cleaned, however I called reception and within 10 minutes someone came to do up the room and replace towels. After that we made sure that we used the clean up my room sign on our door every morning before;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Dan R;Loved it!;Stayed here for 4 nights and would love to come back! The location is good between Kuta and Seminyak and just up the road from a great new mall. It's set well back from the beach and feels very quiet and secluded once you get through the front gate. Breakfasts were very good with something for every taste. The pool is excellent, just pick your times to grab one of the (plentiful) sun loungers. Poolside drinks are abundant or the swim up bar is great. The rooms are very comfortable with all mod cons. Nice big comfy bed. The only unusual part was the bathroom being in the entrance. I can see that they've done it to save space and its kinda clever but it wouldn't be my preference. Otherwise no complaints! Oh and the spa does a fantastic massage for a good price. yes;5;0;1;0;1;0;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;g_beresford;Extravegance in Bali;This was our first visit to Bali, & by luck we were told about the Stones. Not knowing anything about where anything in Bali was, this was a perfect location for anything you wanted to do or see. The layout was ultra modern, clean & very inviting. Nothing was in any way an effort. We could only stay for 2 nights in a ground floor room with a plunge pool,then left for a night, because of availability & came back for another 5 nights in a balcony room with pool view. It was more expensive that I anticipated, but worth every cent. We will be back.;5;1;1;0;0;0;0

A short walk will find you at the beachwalk shops and it's about 20 minute walk to the heart of kuta. Seminyak is also a short drive away.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;18Donald72;The Stones, definitely a gem;Stayed for 8 nights in a pool view room at the end of October and loved the hotel. Location is great, within walking distance to the restaurants and shops of both Kuta and Legian and directly across from Legian beach. The hotel lobby looks OK during the day but is very cool when lit up at night. The pool area is fantastic, the best we have experienced in Bali. The hotel was apparently full while we were there but we never had any difficulty getting day beds with plenty of shade. The fact that pool is quite shallow meant even vertically challenged people like my wife could walk right up to the pool bar and bar staff were regularly coming round with sample soft drinks and cold fruit on skewers. Entertainment in the evening was very nice to sit on the balcony and watch/listen to.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

It's huge beautiful pool and we enjoyed our time there everyday. Foods was great, too. Breakfast had large selection from Western to Balinese style and we loved fresh fruit juice. Dinner and in-room dining were also breautiful. Staff were very friendly and the room was new, nice and clean!. I think kids centre was bit small and limited so kids can't stay too long but at least they have a room for kids to play.

If you love sunset, just walk across the beach side and grab a chair and sit down, enjoy your beer while looking at the beautiful sunset.

The breakfast is fantastic and they make a real cappuccino which is rare. The location of the hotel is good . We enjoy walking so it was 5 minutes walking to Poppy's lane and 20 minutes to the mataharri department store . The hotel is located along the main kuta beach strip closer to legian than kuta .

If you don't want to relax by the huge pool in the hotel, literally just cross the road and you're at the public beach. A convenience store is only a minute walk from the hotel if you need to run any errands. Huge shopping centre with big brands like Victoria Secret, Zara, Top Shop and lots of restaurants of different cuisines (Beachwalk Mall I believe) is only a 10 minute walk from the hotel.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

The buffet breakfast was one of the best I've ever been too. It catered for everything. Eggs cooked to your liking, rotated potato style dishes each morning (hashbrowns, potato, gems etc), a table with a selection of bakery style pastries, donuts, muffins, bread, toast, cereals, ice cream with 6 different flavours, antipasto, asian section with rice,;5;0;0;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Kylie B;Pure Perfection;I really felt the need to do this review and make it quite detailed as Thanks to Trip Advisor this is how our family was blessed to discover the Amazing Stones Hotel. We have just returned from an 8 night stay at The Stones we had two rooms on the second story over looking the pool and the rooms were spotless and finsihed to perfection. The beds and pillows are wonderful and comfortable. The location is fabulous with Kuta Square a 10 minute walk to the left and Melasti Street and Padma Street a 5 minute walk away to the right that to us was perfect. I am saddened and disappointed as to why previous reviewers have said that the security is just too much??? Really what price tag and small amount of time can you place on you and your families safety and well being these;5;1;1;0;0;1;1
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Tarran15;Great location, fantastic staff;I have stayed here on two trips to Bali, and would not stay anywhere else. The staff are friendly and try to accommodate to us anyway they can. On our second trip, it was my parents anniversary and they left a cake, a card signed by all of the staff and rose petals sprinkled in the bath, such a beautiful gesture. Hotel staff get to know you by name and are very friendly and helpful. Hotel Security was great. Location is great, off the main street which means it is quite, but everything is close by so access is easy. When I return to Bali I will stay here again;5;0;1;1;0;0;0

Ad Nauseam: Location is in Legian bali--it's not exactly a quick walk to the beach either, across the road from the busy main drag. If you're here for shopping/nighlife, you're good.

We had a room facing the pool on the highest level (5) of the building. The Hotel is located directly across from the beach and walking distance from plenty of decent bars, restaurants and shops. The Stones is obviously quite young, and has a calming, contemporary interior style.

We got a room that's right at the end so that was a dread walk for us. But it's ok. It's a walking distance to the ever busy Kuta but when you are at the hotel, it's very quiet and peaceful.

The strip is also good for a party, and there are many lounges, pool parties, and bars that you can find here. A very warm welcome included towels and an ice lolly at check-in and an escort to our room where the staff goes through the features. Ground floor rooms have a private plunge pool and higher floors have a balcony equipped with a tub. The plunge pool is really amazing - although it is not heated, which i found the hard way.

Location was the reason why we had chosen this hotel, plus its fairly new. Rooms were not huge, but the bed was excellent. Yes they have a huge pool and that's great, its located in the busy Kuta / Legian area where the beach was just across the street. Breakfast selection was excellent, however ""No Bacon"", which is a crying shame as this hotel is in Bali which is non muslem. Heaps of stores, restaurants and bars within walking distance, hence didn't had a chance to try out the 2 to 3 restaurants in the Hotel. Love the gym, not huge but empty, just like i owned it. Would we return, probably not, not that its a bad hotel, there are just too many new hotels propping up in Bali. Overall, I would recommend it.";4;0;1;0;0;0;1

Management tried to say that we had miscounted or been short changed by a money exchange even though the money had been counted twice that morning rather than addressing the issue. Management conducted their own fruitless investigation and staff of course denied all.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;MikieMikey;Average;I have never stayed in this hotel before. And before I decided to stay here I didn't read any reviews regarding this property. The location itself is quite strategic. A 2 minutes walk from Kuta beach, 10 minutes walk from Beachwalk, 10 minutes drive to Jalan Raya Legian and 15 minutes drive to Discovery Mall/Waterbom. But bear in mind that traffic in this area can be a real nightmare. Upon entering the hotel it was pretty impressive (although the over the top security check can be quite exhaustive sometimes). The check in process took painfully long. I didn't know if the receptionist officer is new or she just works slow in general. The room is pretty impressive. Very clean as well (that is what is most important to me).;3;0;1;0;0;1;0

Around the pool area if they are not cleaning your sunglasses they are bringing you free fruit sticks , face cold towels or face fresh sprays.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;A Raz;Reasonable price, satisfying service;I stayed at this hotel for three nights during my business trip in Denpasar. The hotel is located between Kuta and Legian and its surrounding is not so crowded so it's a good place for resting. The price was also reasonable because actually my trip was only for two days but I extended it because I wanted to have my own vacation and they still gave me the corporate rate. The hotel was good-looking and the room was nice. But I was so disappointed when I figured out that it only had bathtub for couple rooms (my room was a double one). In terms of service, my room was a bit smelly and my colleague complained about that. Finally they gave us a new upgraded room (pool view) as a compliment, which was nice. Overall I really enjoy my stay. Good location.;5;1;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;pamelao48;PERFECT HOLIDAY;We have stayed at THE STONES-LEGIAN, the last 3 times we have been to Bali. We found this Hotel to be in a great location. The food is amazing and especially the breakfasts which cater for everybody's needs and tastes. The Rooms are very spacious with VERY COMFORTABLE BEDS. Hotel Security is another plus for the Stones. Pool area is beautiful with gardens and lounges and pool bar, you will not want for anything if you choose to stay at this Hotel. We are planning our next holiday now............ Guess where we will stay????????;5;0;1;0;1;0;1

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;CanberraMandy;Amazing luxury in Bali;This is a fabulous hotel in a convenient location, close to the wonderful Seminyak shopping and dining precincts. Rooms are beautifully appointed, the view over the pool is just gorgeous and nothing beats a candlelit bath on your balcony (although the plunge pool suites come close!) The food is absolutely outstanding - the best buffet breakfast in Bali - covering all cuisines and even 6 different ice cream selections each day!;5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Budapest4Lausanne;Best Hotel in Legian, Bali - hands down;This is probably the best hotel i have spend a few days at. The location is excellent (not in Kuta which is over grown party area, not in Semeniak which is more for those looking for a good retreat). The facilities are excellent (reception, extra large gym, 3 wonderful restaurants). The breakfast is out of this world (we even got a chocolate fountain section!). The ambiance is relaxing and yet upscale. The bar offers outstanding cocktails. etc and etc..And the service, just so friendly and attentive. A wonderful, wonderful hotel!;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;shishirgoel;Perfect location;Perfectly located on Kuta beach. Lots of good restaurants nearby. Do not miss the breakfast at the stones kitchen. Recommended if you just want to spend time on the beach, exploring good food, shopping and staying indoors. If you want to spend your whole day seeing Bali and just want to be back for the night's sleep, it feels expensive.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Aido22;First trip to Bali;Awesome stay, 5 nights and would love to return. Clean and the best breakfast selection ever. Highly recommended.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;MJB493;Great but not amazing;The Stones is a beautiful hotel! Very modern, clean. The food and drinks are delicious! I also liked the heavy security to get into the hotel - it made me feel very safe. Pool and lounge area is nice also. The hotel was very quite and not many people were there, so if you like more of an atmosphere I wouldn't stay here. I didn't like how the room is all open and there is nothing separating the bathroom from the bedroom (especially since my boyfriend had bali belly lol). However I did enjoy the bathtub on the balcony! The location is excellent! Not in the central of Kuta but a little bit out. Lots of attractions are within walking distance.;4;0;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;AlbyGee;Clean and modern hotel with friendly staff;Our families and friends stayed at the Stones hotel for 5 nights leading up to our wedding in Bali. We arrived at the hotel late at night and found check in to be easy. The hotel is located on the main beach strip in Kuta/ Legian area and is a good location to local shopping and restaurants. The Stones is a relatively newish hotel and the furniture and décor are modern, new and clean. We had the breakfast buffet daily and found they had a good range. They had a really delicious 'herbal energy' juice which had beetroot, ginger and lemongrass in it, which I loved! There was a pool bar, which was fun, although we found that cocktails were pretty expensive for that type of hotel (like $15 aus!!!!!);4;0;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;2LivingTheLife;WOW in Legian;First Hotel on our first trip to Bali - and we hit the jackpot! Great location - across the beach in Legian. But who needs to go to the beach if you have this HUGE pool! A bit larger a hotel than we normally stay in (in terms of room numbers) - but we were surprised by how quiet the room was as it was fully booked out (some having an 'enforced' stay due to the ash cloud grounding the planes). We stayed in a top floor pool view room which was spacious and clean. Our large balcony contained a daybed, and a beautiful free-standing bath tub! A curtain could be pulled across the balcony, providing total privacy. But the large shower with its rainwater shower head was our daily choice. The only minor complaint we had is that the live music from the bar area across the pool on some;5;0;1;0;1;1;0

Big hotel with many rooms. The lobby, pool side bar, restaurants were nicely decorated. very ""resort"" feel in the heart of Legian The breakfast buffet was average. Had better breakfast at other hotels of this scale. one the last day, my colleague told me the plug hole which is made of tile, was shifted slighted by the previous housekeepers. That night when got back late, she found a cockroach coming through! What a shock she had!.She managed to whack it with a slipper. I told the housekeeping department to go get it removed.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;DragonYg;Back To Bali;We are back to The Stones and yet again we are not disappointed with their warm hospitality. Love this hotel.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Vania Teja;Great Hotel with Comfy Pool;It's quite far to reach the lobby from the main street. But the lobby is so impressing with their architecture and you also can feel the beach wind. The pool is really great, the pool area is so comfy and theres also a couch, hammock, and gazebo around the pool. When I got to the room, my first impression is this room is clean and would make my trip in Bali unforgettable. But then I realized that there's so many mosquitos in the room, although the hotel already provided electric mosquito killer. Maybe because the aisle carpet color is black and need more lightning. The location of this hotel is in front of the beach, so you can easily reach the beach to enjoy sunset or any beach activity. It's also near to Legian, but if you want to go to Beachwalk or Kuta Square or Hard Rock;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Breakfast was superb and this was the first time that I could enjoy my breakfast in 5 star hotel in Bali. Quality and quantity was thumb up. Location is tourist area and nearby to famous Kuta beach. The hotel is pricey especially if you are using only for sleep;4;0;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Becca;Excellent Staff and a Nearly Perfect Stay;My husband and I have just returned from a 2 week honeymoon where we stayed 11 nights at The Stones, Bali after having a busy 3 days in Singapore. Quite a lengthy review because it was an important holiday, and we have a lot to let the hotel know about as feedback to improve for future guests. Location The Stones is in a great location - a short walk into lively Kuta but also a short walk to Legian beach where there is a vast amount of beach bars and restaurants. Nearby is also the beach walk shopping centre and the markets. The beach is literally across the busy road. Located right outside the hotel itself is The Stones Entertainment Bar which is handy if you don't want to stray too far. We went there on our first night as it was quite intimidating on a rowdy Saturday night;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;SanClemenRAM;Secluded Western Retreat in the Kuta Area;This hotel was amazing. I would expect nothing less from the Marriott Autograph Collection. With that said, this hotel is at a fraction of the price of what you would pay in the US. Located just on the beach they have a great location for shopping, dinning, drinking, and surfing. From the moment we arrived for our honeymoon (at 3 AM thanks to flight delays) they were ready and waiting for us with smiles and an ice cold popsicle (even at that time it was hot!). The hotel is located well off the main road. Cars must take part in a vehicle inspection and there is a metal detector to walk through, which makes you feel very safe (not that Bali was unsafe in any way).;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

We wanted to stay out of Kuta but be close to the beach and this is a short walk to the beach. Beds are comfortable. Bar fridge isn't cold in room. Security coming in and out of hotel gave me a great sense of safety. Breakfast was unbelievably good - never seen such variety. Bar service around the pool can be slack in the afternoon but spot on in the morning shift. Loungers are in the water so you just roll off for a swim - perfect!;4;0;1;0;0;1;1

The facilities were great, modern and clean and the location is great. Breakfast was also a real highlight with a large variety of options. A very special mention to Mike who came around daily offering to clean sunglasses, hand out fruit sticks and refreshing beverages. On departure we realised that we had left our Bose speaker around the pool. After a frantic phone call to the resort our friend Mike informed us that he had found the speaker and offered to bring it to us at our next resort on his day off!;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Yvanna F;Unreal service;The Stones hotel for the most part has been beautiful! The food is also another highlight of this hotel, three menus to choose from and all the meals are superb. The only downfall of the hotel: - it's located on a one way street so to get here with a cab in traffic is nearly impossible in under 30 minutes, even to get to Seminyak or central Kuta which should only be maximum 10 minutes away. - location is great though in regards to its proximity for the beachwalk and is directly opposite Kuta beach. - the sun chairs by the pool are great and I love the touch of them being in the water, but the design of the hotel;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ginab1964;Great pool & service, weird but nice rooms, ordinary location;The best part of the hotel was the pool area - just fantastic, with terrific service and the poolside food (in fact all the hotel food) was the best I've eaten in Bali, really just amazing. Nice rooftop bar too, with great food. The location is a bit no-mans land ie opposite the beach (although with that pool, don't bother) but probably 15min walk to Kuta, and an hour to Seminyak. Cabs are cheap and plentiful but the traffic is so terrible that you will sit in the cab for 45min to get to Kuta and Seminyak, which is annoying.;4;1;1;0;0;0;0

Food is great, reasonable price for such a great hotel. Location is brilliant, lots to walk to in all directions, restaurants, shopping, beach across road is also good. It is the small things that surprise you, guy playing beautifully in the saxophone while we swim at 4pm, DJ on the roof spinning tunes (stops by 8pm). Highly recommended for a holiday break. Probably harder for little kids as not much space to run around unless in pool.;5;1;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;FairytaleM00N;Good hotel in convenient location;Good location in Seminyak / Legian area within walking distance to shopping & entertainment places.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;MLR987;Elegance in the busiest part of Bali;Super well situated , if traffic is your issue this may not be the best place, but for a hotel within 50 m of the beach, lots of therapy centers, shops and restaurants. The location is perfect. There IS building refurb work going on, but there was no noise or inconvinience, the staff however and their incredibly professional service overshadow one piece of scaffolding near the pool. The food is so reasonable, and the quality exceptional. My colleagues took the beef steaks one night and rated it as one of the best ever. I had the tuna steak with rice ,;5;1;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Randal Elido;Our stay in Bali was ok;We stayed in The Stones Hotel. Generally, it was ok. The location was great since it is walking distance from the beach and from the shopping and dining district of Kuta. The one way road was a bit challenging though if you take a car or a taxi since you need to go around and drive through traffic just to get to commercial areas. Amenities was also great. They had a great pool and the room had a nice layout. Both were resolved though. As for breakfast, everthing essential was available from an egg station to breads to western food and even local food. However, their variety can still improve especially on what they offer on;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Jolin_Chang;Good location and nice staff;We stayed for two nights at the Stones (deluxe room, ground floor, room# 160, no view). Will suggest to have pool view room at higher floors, otherwise it could be quite boring staying in the room. The breakfast is about the average and the highlight to me is the fresh juices and milkshakes made your ways. The location is good, the beach walk mall is ~ 20 mins walking and the other famous restaurants (ex: hard rock) and SPA. Could be a good choice for your 1st time Bali.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;John B;Great hotel, amazing staff and gym;Great hotel, the gym was one of the best of the 5star hotels I have stayed in in Bali.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;GlobalDads;Fabulous and easily the best in Legian or Kuta;We moved here from the not so impressive Padma (see other review) and the Stones was a world apart. A SUITE was cheaper than a normal room at the Padma, and included free massages in the gorgeous spa, a buffet dinner and shopping vouchers. ROOM: beautiful. L-shaped, with table/spare bed area in one section, massive sofa, gorgeous bathroom with bath on the very large balcony. FOOD: excellent and affordable. Breakfast great choice of Asian/Western, sitting inside or out. Pizzas great. LOCATION: also great - 2 minutes from Jalan Melasti one way, or 7-8 minutes from the new mall by the Sheraton if that's your thing. Easy cab into Seminyak.;5;1;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;akiliu;it's a very convenient location;Good: 1. Location: very convenient location for beach activity lover, just 5 mins walking to the beach and there is a surfing store next to the main entrance. 2. F&B: The Bar /restaurant along swimming poolside, nice place to dining and breakfast while enjoy the great view and sunshine, many options for westerners but not much for Asian though, the highlight is fresh-made juice base on your personal request. on top on that, all hotel guest got 20%off from the overall bill or if you have AMEX card. 4. Room: good size with modern design, open concept to toilet room which make the corridor disappeared ! 5. The Spa is nice should give a try.;3;0;1;0;1;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;ClareandMichaelPerth;Nice boutique hotel in great location;My husband and I stayed at The Stones in Legian for two nights at the end of a trip to Bali in June 2016. It's in a great location, right in the middle of Legian on the beachfront. The presentation of the hotel is trendy and clean. Our room overlooked the nicely layed out pool area and our room was trendy and clean. Rooms are reasonably priced and very cool. The best thing about this hotel is the buffet breakfast. We have been to Bali on several occasions previously and The Padma in Legian was always our favourite breakfast buffet. The Stones breakfast buffet is;5;1;1;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;VascoDeGama1963;Location , Location;Centrally located approx 25 minutes from the airport The Stones is a larger hotel by Bali standards right across the road from the beach on the border of Legian and Kuta. Clean , modern rooms have everything u need with great air conditioning. We spent 5 nights here just after new years in 2017 on a last minute planned trip. I highly recommend the pool view rooms with the free standing bath on the balcony. Go to the local 7/11 or supermarket and buy 3 bags of ice on the way back to the hotel from any day trip and the bath is a beautifully refreshing thing compared to the pool which is normally 28 degrees . great buffet breakfasts included in the price with real coffee and in walking distance from supermarkets and over 100 restaurants. Highly recommended.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Only drawback was the room didn't have a balcony, but not really an issue; room was very comfortable with ample room; good air-conditioning; always clean; had all bathroom amenities that we needed (and the fridge was completely empty, which was perfect i.e. no mini bar stuff to clutter it). Location was excellent; right across from the beach. Plenty of local shops, restaurants and massage places nearby. It took us about 25 minutes to walk into Kuta, which is probably only 10 mins more than driving.";5;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;nesiana;great location;I had a great two nights stay in this hotel. It located near the Kuta Beach, walking distance to the beachwalk mall. The breakfast menu was good although not too special, and I was always almost not getting any bacon. The second day I got the last portion they've had. I think you should stock pork bacon--only when requested. The room was as other rooms, I love the bed and the comfort. I don't like the bathroom. it did not have a cloth hanger inside. I had to reach out outside to put the towel and clothes. It wasn't effective at all.;4;0;1;0;0;0;1

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ari K;Not that luxurious;The Stones is perfect for its location at the front beach of Kuta and in the center of Kuta's night life and shopping spree. For the hotel itself, I do not see something extraordinary in terms of its swimming pool or its restaurant. Still it is a nice hotel to stay, especially if you are looking for the locations in Kuta area.;3;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;jellyfishking;Thoroughly enjoyable;My family or 4 (2 adults and 2 teenage girls) stayed at the Stones for 4 nights. We paid for two standard rooms, but on arrival one room was upgarded to a suite. The rooms were side by side as requested. The rooms were stunning. Very spacious. The suite had 2 TVs, a king-size bed, a dual shower (no bathtub) a sitting room and a (pod) coffee machine. The rooms were clean and modern. The wifi was free, fast and reliable, even at the pool. The pool was huge and plenty of room to sit around. Pool service was quite good. Happy hour was 3-6 pm and reasonable for beer and limited cocktails. The location on the hotel is ideal - central Legian - walking distance to major shops, restaurants and bars. I have been to Bali 14 times and this is by far the best Hotel I've stayed in (although I;5;0;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;djmcenergy;Outstanding service;we have been back here 3 times and each visit its still got the high standard.

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Theresiagrapsas;Birthday getaway;What a lovely hotel, great location, beautiful clean rooms and bag tub on the balcony or dunk pools on bottom floor. Drinks not badly priced. Breakfast was good, but struggled getting tea with breakfast used to take them forever to get boiling water, tea bag and some milk. Pool area great plenty of seating arrangements and lunch menu yum 👌;5;1;1;0;1;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;FlyWithKids;Great hotel;"Location is not great. Because it has only one entrance, it's difficult to get in or out by car, every 15 minute walk translates into a 45 min car ride because of heavy traffic and one way steers around the hotel. Access to the beach takes a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Beach (public) is pretty dirty and very busy; but the waves are a lot of fun. Tons of surfing activity. Hotel is beautiful, it has a traditional Indonesian orchestra in the lobby; and when the musicians are there playing it's almost magical. Rooms are spacious, the suites are very large, tons of space, 3 tables, large bathroom with a nice bathtub and a double shower. Only wished there was a balcony for the suite as there are for the double rooms. Pools are nice and calm. There is a live DJ in the";4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;desai66;Walking Distance from Legian Beach and Kuta;Location is excellent as it is right in front of Legian Beach and is walkable distance to many areas of Kuta. we walked to the sky garden lounge and back and we also walked back from seminyak beach which is 2km away, not very close but still walkable, it has a nice pool which is in the centre of the hotel and many were enjoying. The room though could have been better with better maintenance and upkeep. This was the most expensive hotel in our tour of Bali, Gili and Yogyakarta and so we felt it could have been better as the rooms in all the other hotels was much better and a lot more cheaper. The entry to the room is through the washroom which felt a bit strange.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;BunburyMaccas;Lots to like;Well it is a quality resort for all the right reasons, apart from a glitch with the shower that was resolved after a couple of repairs it is very good . The breakfast is wonderfull , most of the meals were very nice ,the staff were very helpfully and as we had a scoop on the free bucket of beer per day was great . The security is high and that is a good thing , I would stay again with another special , the location is central and not far from matahari.;4;0;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Dibbie66;Brilliant staff, great hotel;The staff at this hotel are what made our 5 night stay so great, from the cleaners to the wait staff, they are all so friendly, really helpful and eager to please. The hotel itself is really nice and in a brilliant location which makes it easy to get everywhere and in walking distant to a lot of places. The hotel is modern and clean but very large so it was sometimes a struggle to get a table at breakfast on the busy days that wasn't miles away from the buffet. Our only minor niggle was the size of our room, the bathroom area was massive but the bedroom area was a little on the small side making it a bit of a squeeze with cases etc. Our friends room next door was bigger even though they had booked the same room as us, the extra space making it much more comfy.;4;0;1;1;1;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Annie0608;Nice boutique hotel;Nice clean rooms. Upon check in, they gave you a popsicle and cold towels to freshen up. The location is also good, near a Latest mall in the Kuta beach. The pool is also very nice with a pool side bar.;5;0;1;0;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;leeds30;Best Location and Staff;We stayed at The Stones for 10 days , only wish it was for longer. From the moment we arrived, security was evident, Nothing taken for granted. Could not find one fault with this hotel. The breakfast, you are spoilt for choice, even the fussiest eater was accommodated. The rooms spotless, and nothing too much trouble, We spoke to the Manager Daryn ,and his assistant, when they checked on EVERYTHING each day, My special thanks to WAWAN , for all his help and advise ,over looking the beach, within walking distance of other bars, restaurant's and shops, all the staff are very friendly, only wish we lived nearer so we could visit again ,;5;0;1;1;0;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Ryan J;FIrst Class Oasis within steps of Kuta Beach;We had a deluxe room on the main floor with a direct view of the pool (phenomenal), and a pool in the room (amazing after a hot day sunning). The location is ideal - close to good pubs and bars, some shopping nearby, right next to surf schools (and one in the Hotel complex). What makes it a fantastic hotel are the staff, the breakfast and location. Price is incredible, too. Steps from the beach, a breakfast which is as good as I have seen anywhere, and the staff are simply gracious and welcoming. I would always stay here while in Bali!;5;1;1;1;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Yossarrian;Nice place, great service;My wife and I were there in November 2018 for our 20th anniversary. Dining facilities were great and food was plentiful and of good quality. My only knock was the location-Kuta beach. The hotel itself is across from the beach, the area is a surfers paradise. But the scooters constantly buzzing around, even on the side walks, made it hard to take a relaxing walk.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

The only downside is the drinks are a bit pricey and theres only two chairs at the pool bar. Other than that its perfect.;5;0;0;0;0;1;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;piksla;Lovely hotel with great location;If you want to be near Kuta and right by the beach, this hotel is a great choice.

Fitness room was well appointed. Hotel is very clean and staff are helpful.;5;0;1;1;1;1;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Claire B;Visit October 2017;I stayed at the Stones in October 2017. The good (great actually): we were upgraded to a beautiful suite overlooking the pool, the servers at the pool were amazing and the food and drinks at the restaurant were delicious. The location was also good, right across the street from the beach. Unfortunately, on our last night, a housekeeping person entered our room unannounced (he said he knocked but I did not hear anything). It made me uncomfortable and instead of simply leaving he stayed and tried to explain why he came in. This is why I did not give this hotel a 5.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;stellajane;Not bad;The weather wasn’t ideal but the location is about 30 mins away from the airport. We were there for a sales conference and they have plenty of rooms to accommodate 150 of us. They do have a security at the front counter where you will have to go through the metal detector but that’s fine. Shops are within walking distance and the beach is just in front.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;harihar2017;Decent hotel, in a very happening location;"was attending a conference at the hotel over 2 and 3 march ; the biggest draw of this hotel is its location, as it is located bang opposite the legian beach, and the entire road is full of action in terms of pubs and malls and thus you could enjoy the night life very well. the hotel is good without being extraordinary. the rooms don't have a great view ( mine had a view of some houses ) ; but the killer fact is that you could step out of the hotel and get straight into the action on the roads.";3;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Mohammad Hidaya... R;Great location and beautiful hotel;Surprise. We had amazing experience in the hotel. unfortunately we never had the time to experience the pool (we skipped the pool to experience the beach. Kuta beach is practically in the front of the hotel). The pool is beautiful though... Love it. hope we can go back there again. downside: It took longer than expected to check in. It seemed we came during some medical conference and the staffs was overwhelmed.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Libby S;Nice and neat, fantastic staff;We stayed at the Stones for 3 nights, as a family of 5. The resort is probably suited more for couples or couples with small children, however we would happily recommend it to anyone who wants to be in the vibrant Legian area. Fantastic Wifi, We loved the giant pool and the spa. Fitness Centre was very impressive, with 24 hours and great facilities and equipment Great location, right on the beachfront and 5 minutes walk to the beachwalk shopping centre (H&M, Zara, topshop etc) Fantastic breakfast buffet, with everything from the traditional eggs, great selection of pastries, excellent coffee & even milkshakes and icecream for the kids.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0
Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Dan;Pleasant stay;Interesting Marriott autograph hotel. Each autograph has a different theme and design. Location: Very near to Legian beach. Near to shopping centres, lots of food options available i.e. Fat bowl. Recommend to visit Yes Spa which is about 12 mins walk away. - Geger beach - You can borrow the hotel's bicycles to cycle to Geger beach, which takes about 10 minutes. Price: Average. Pool: Huge Room: Gearing towards the small side. Beds were small. Breakfast serving: Fantastic.;4;0;1;0;0;0;0

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Sarah C;Awesome location;The stones is an incredible hotel. The location is amazing. Straight across from the beach. The resort is wrapped around the pool. The pool is huge and has a pool bar. My favourite thing about this hotel is the breakfast bar. Huge huge selection which includes a doughnut wall. And they will make you fresh pancakes. I had gluten free pancakes. Awesome spread. The room itself was modern and large. The toilet and shower has a see through door but they look over the rest of the room. But they have a curtain than you can pull around and cover the toilet and shower if you want. They have really cool pool suites aswell.;4;0;1;0;1;0;0

Walking distance to Beachwalk, Poppies Lane, heaps of restaurants, spas and markets. The breakfast is fantastic. Pool is great. It’s only downfall is that there are not enough sun beds. I noticed that people reserve the beds by putting the pool towel on the bed they want. I saw this being done as early as 7am. I honestly think this is unfair and staff should remove those towels from the beds if they have been untouched for one hour.;5;0;1;0;0;0;0

This was probably the only downside of our stay. The pool is large but getting a lounge can be difficult. Breakfast is great - there are a lot of choices to chose from!

Legian Kuta Bali;The Stones Hotel Legian Bali;Michelle;Beautiful property & very friendly staff;This hotel was one of our favourites in Bali! The location is great, with plenty of shops & restaurants reachable with a short walk. The hotel staff is what really makes it stand out, everyone was very friendly and always willing to offer any help we needed. I especially want to point out the excellent service from Khansa, the guest experience representative. She greeted us upon arrival, and took time to chat with us about our stay and find out what we had planned during our stay. She really went above & beyond to arrange some special experiences for us, and ensure we had everything we needed during our stay. We look forward to visiting again!;5;0;1;1;0;0;0
